 in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], two [[Events|events]] are mutually exclusive (disjoint) if they cannot occur at the same time. the simplest example of mutually exclusive events is a coin toss. 
 
 a tossed coin outcome can be either head or tails, but both outcomes cannot occur simultaneously.

in other words, two events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if their [[Intersection of events|intersection]] is an [[Empty set|empty set]], and therefore the [[Probability|probability]] of them occurring at the same time will always be zero.

$$
\begin{align}
A\cap B=\emptyset \\
\\
P(A\cap B)=0 \\
\end{align}
