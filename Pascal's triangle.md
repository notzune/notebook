Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]] arising in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], [[Combinatorics|combinatorics]], and [[Algebra|algebra]].

the rows of pascal's triangle are conventionally [[Enumeration|enumerated]] starting with $n=0$ at the top (the 0th row).

the entries in each row are numbered from left beginning with $k=0$ and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.
