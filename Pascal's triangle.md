Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]] arising in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], [[Combinatorics|combinatorics]], and [[Algebra|algebra]].

the rows of pascal's triangle are conventionally [[Enumeration|enumerated]] starting with $n=0$ at the top (the 0th row).

the entries in each row are numbered from left beginning with $k=0$ and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.

formally, the entry in the $n$th row and $k$th column of Pascal's triangle is denoted $\binom{n}{k}$. for example, the unique nonzero entry in the topmost row is $\binom{0}{0}=1$.

$$
\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}
$$

for any non-negative [[Integer|integer]] $n$ and any integer $0\leq k\leq n$.

this [[Recurrence relation|recurrence]] for the binomial coefficients is known as [[Pascal's rule]]
