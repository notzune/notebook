from the definition of [[Conditional probability|conditional probability]] $P(A\mid B)$ the probability of the [[Intersection of events|intersection of two events]] $A\cap B$ can be calculated as

$$
P(A\cap B)=P(B)P(A\mid B)
$$

which in words is, the probability of events $A$ and $B$ both occurring at the same time can be found by multiplying the probability of event $B$ by the probability of event $A$ conditional on event $B$. 

by the same definition, $P(B\mid A)$ would be

$$
P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B\mid A)
$$
