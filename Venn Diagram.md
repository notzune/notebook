a Venn diagram provides an intuitive way to visualize [[Sets|sets]] and [[Subset|subsets]] as well as their [[Relation|relations]].

here are examples:

each circle represents a set while the background rectangle represents the universal set ($U$)

## Example problem #1[^1]

in a group of **191** students:

- 10 are taking french, business, and music
- 20 are taking french and music
- 18 are taking business and music
- 65 are taking french
- 76 are taking business
- 63 are taking music

### breaking down the problem

lets break down the problem first, we can split up the problem into different [[Sets|sets]] to represent the different "majors", with the [[Universal set|universal set]] being the set of all students $\mathbb{U}={F, B, M}$ where $F,B,M$ represent {French, Business, and Music} respectively.

now we can break down the problem further, we can assume that students taking more than one "major" are an [[Intersection|intersection of two sets]]:

- $|F\cap B\cap M|=10$ since there are 10 students taking all 3.
- $|F\cap M|=20$
- $|B\cap M|=18$
- $F=65$
- $B=76$
- $M=63$

### how many are taking french and music but not business? 

### how many are taking business but neither french or music?


## Example problem #2

there is a total of **165** students, of those 165:

- 8 are taking calculus, psychology, and CS
- 33 are taking calculus and CS
- 20 are taking calculus and psychology
- 79 are taking calculus
- 83 are taking psychology
- 63 are taking CS

### breaking down the problem

$\mathbb{U}=\{C,P,CS\}$


### how many are not taking calc, psych, or CS?

[^1]: this problem is really confusing if you aren't paying close attention, so lock in.
