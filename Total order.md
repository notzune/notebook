in mathematics, a total order or linear order is a [[Partially ordered set|partial order]] in which any two [[Element|elements]] are comparable.

that is a total order is a [[Binary relation|binary relation]] $\leq$ on some [[Sets|set]] $X$, which satisfies the following for all $a,b$ and $c$ in $X$:

1. $a\leq a$ ([[Reflexive relation|reflexive]])
2. if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq c$ then $a\leq c$ ([[Transitive relation|transitive]])
3. if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq a$ then $a=b$ ([[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]])
4. if $a\leq b$ or $b\leq a$ ([[Connected relation|strongly connected]], formerly called total)
