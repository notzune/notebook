separation of variables (also known as the Fourier method) is any of several methods for solving [[Ordinary differential equation (ODE)|ordinary]] and [[Partial differential equation (PDE)|partial differential equations]], in which algebra allows one to rewrite an equation so that each of two variables occurs on a different side of the equation.

## Ordinary differential equations (ODE)

a differential equation for the unknown $f(x)$ will be separable if it can be written in the form

$$
\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=g(x)h(f(x))
$$

where $g$ and $h$ are given functions. this is more transparent when writing $y=f(x)$ as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y)
$$

so now as long as $h(y)\neq0$, we can arrange the terms to obtain:

$$
\frac{dy}{h(y)}=g(x)dx,
$$

where the two variables $x$ and $y$ have been separated. note
