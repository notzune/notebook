the axiom of extensionality, or the axiom of extension, is one of the axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel]] set theory (ZF), which is a standard form of axiomatic set theory in the foundation of mathematics.

this axiom states that two [[Sets|sets]] are equal if and only if they have the same elements. in other words, a set is determined solely by its elements, without regard to the order or repetition of these elements.

formally, the axiom of extensionality can be written as:

for any sets $A$ and $B$, $A=B$ if and only if for every element $x$, $x$ is an element of $A$ if and only if $x$ is an element of $B$.

in [[Logical notation|logical notation]], this is often expressed as:

$$
\forall A\forall B(A = B\leftrightarrow\forall x(x\in A\leftrightarrow x\in B))
$$

this formal expression can be read as: "for all sets A and B, A is equal to B if and only if for every object x, x is an element of A if and only if x is an element of B."
