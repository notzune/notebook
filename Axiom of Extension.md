the axiom of extensionality, or the axiom of extension, is one of the axioms of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel]] set theory (ZF), which is a standard form of axiomatic set theory in the foundation of mathematics.

this axiom states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. In other words, a set is determined solely by its elements, without regard to the order or repetition of these elements.

formally, the axiom of xxtensionality can be written as:

for any sets A and B, A = B if and only if for every element x, x is an element of A if and only if x is an element of B.

in logical notation, this is often expressed as:

$$\forall A \forall B (A = B \leftrightarrow \forall x (x \in A \leftrightarrow x \in B))$$

this formal expression can be read as: "for all sets A and B, A is equal to B if and only if for every object x, x is an element of A if and only if x is an element of B."
