in math and [[Physics|physics]], a vector space (also called linear space) is a [[Sets|set]] whose [[Element|elements]], often called [[Vectors|vectors]] may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers called [[Scalar|scalars]]. 

Scalars are often [[Real numbers|real numbers]], but can be [[Complex numbers|complex]] or more generally elements of any [[Field|field]]. 

the [[Operation|operations]] of vector addition and [[Scalar multiplication|scalar multiplication]] must satisfy certain requirements called vector axioms.

the concept of vector spaces is fundamental for [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]], together with the concept of [[Matrices|matrices]] which allows [[Computing|computing]] in vector spaces.

this provides a way for manipulating and studying [[System of linear equations|systems of linear equations.]]
