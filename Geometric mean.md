the geometric mean is a [[Mean|mean]] or average which indicates a [[Central tendency|central tendency]] of a finite [[Sets|set]] of [[Real numbers|real numbers]] by using the product of their values (as opposed to the [[Arithmetic mean|arithmetic mean]] which uses their sum). 

the geometric mean is defined as the $n$th root of the product of $n$ numbers.

for a set of numbers $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$, the geometric mean is defined as

$$
\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_i\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\dots a_n}
$$

or as the arithmetic mean in [[Logarithmic scale|logscale]]:

$$
\exp\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\ln a_i\right)
$$
