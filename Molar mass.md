in [[Chemistry|chemistry]], the molar mass ($M$) of a [[Chemical compound|chemical compound]] is defined as the ratio between the [[Mass|mass]] of the [[Amount of substance|amount of substance]] (measured in [[Mole (unit)|moles]]) of any sample of the compound.

the molar mass is a bulk, not molecular, property of a substance and is an average of many instances of the compound which often vary in mass due to the presence of [[Isotope|isotopes]].

molar mass is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive]] property of the substance that does not depend on the size of the sample.

the molar mass of [[Atom|atoms]] of an [[Chemical element|element]] is given by the relative atomic mass of the element multiplied by the [[Molar mass constant|molar mass constant]], $M_u\approx1\times10^{-3}\space\text{kg}\cdot\text{mol}^{-1}$ (or, $\approx1\space\text{g/mol}$). 

for example:

$$
\begin{align*}
&M(\text{H}) &= 1.00797 \times M_u &= 1.00797 \text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{S}) &= 32.065 \times M_u &= 32.065 \text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{Cl}) &= 35.453 \times M_u &= 35.453 \text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{Fe}) &= 55.845 \times M_u &= 55.845 \text{ g/mol} \\
\end{align*}
$$

or for [[Molecule|molecules]] such as [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] ($\text{H}_{2}$), [[Sulfur|sulfur]] ($\text{S}_{8}$), [[Chlorine|chlorine]] ($\text{Cl}_{2}$), the molar mass of the molecules of these elements is the molar mass of the atoms multiplied by the number of atoms in each molecule:

$$
\begin{align*}
&M(\text{H}_{2}) &= 2 \times 1.00797 \times M_u &= 2.01594 \text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{S}_{8}) &= 8 \times 32.065 \times M_u &= 256.52 \text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{Cl}_{2}) &= 2 \times 35.453 \times M_u &= 70.906 \text{ g/mol} \\
\end{align*}
$$

the molar mass of a compound is given by the sum of the [[Relative atomic mass|relative atomic mass]] $A_r$ of the atoms which form the compound multiplied by the molar mass constant $M_u\approx1\space\text{g/mol}$:

$$
M=M_uM_r=M_u\sum_iA_{ri}
$$

here, $M_r$ is the relative molar mass, also referred to as formula weight.

$$
\begin{align*}
&M(\text{NaCl}) &= \left[ 22.98976928 + 35.453 \right] \times 1 \text{ g/mol} \\
&&= 58.443\text{ g/mol} \\
\\
&M(\text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{22}\text{O}_{11}) &= \left[ 12 \times 12.0107 + 22 \times 1.00794 + 11 \times 15.9994 \right] \times 1 \text{ g/mol} \\
&&= 342.297\text{ g/mol} \\
\end{align*}
$$

the average molar mass of mixtures $\overline{M}$ can be calculated from the [[Mole fraction|mole fractions]] $x_i$ of the components and their molar masses $M_i$.

$$
\overline{M}=\sum_ix_iM_i
$$

it can also be calculated from the [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fractions]] $w_i$ of the components:

$$
\frac{1}{M}=\sum_i\frac{w_i}{M_i}
$$

as an example the average molar mass of dry air is 28.97 g/mol:

dry air is primarily composed of [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]] ($\text{N}_2$), [[Oxygen|oxygen]] ($\text{O}_2$), Argon ($\text{Ar}$), and [[Carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]] ($\text{CO}_2$), along with trace amounts of other gases. for simplicity, we will only consider the major components:

$$
\begin{align}
&M_{\text{N}_{2}}&=28.014\space\text{g/mol} \\
&M_{\text{O}_{2}}&=31.998\space\text{g/mol} \\
&M_{\text{Ar}}&=39.948\space\text{g/mol} \\
&M_{\text{CO}_{2}}&=44.01\space\text{g/mol} \\
\end{align}
$$

we then take the generally accepted average values based on the composition of Earth's atmosphere:

- nitrogen $(\text{N}_2)\approx 78\%$
- oxygen $(\text{O}_2)\approx 21\%$ by volume.
- argon $(\text{Ar})\approx 0.93\%$ by volume.
- carbon $(\text{CO}_2)\approx 0.04\%$ by volume

these percentages are then converted into mole fractions (which, in the case of gases in a mixture like air, are approximately equal to volume fractions because of the properties of gases under the [[Ideal gas law|ideal gas law]]).

- $x_{\text{N}_2}=0.78$
- $x_{\text{O}_2}=0.21$
- $x_{\text{Ar}}=0.0093$
- - $x_{\text{CO}_2}=0.0004$

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{M}_{\text{dry air}} &= x_{\text{N₂}} M_{\text{N₂}} + x_{\text{O₂}} M_{\text{O₂}} + x_{\text{Ar}} M_{\text{Ar}} + x_{\text{CO₂}} M_{\text{CO₂}} \\
&= (0.78 \times 28.014) + (0.21 \times 31.998) + (0.0093 \times 39.948) + (0.0004 \times 44.01) \\
&= 21.89092 + 6.71958 + 0.3716214 + 0.017604 \\
&\approx 28.99972 \text{ g/mol}
\end{align*}
