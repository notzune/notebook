in mathematics and [[Statistics|statistics]], a quantitative [[Variables|variable]] may be **continuous** or **discrete** if they are obtained by *measuring*, or *counting* (respectively).

# Continuous variable

a continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring, i.e. a variable which can take on an [[Uncountable set|uncountable set]] of values.

for example, a variable over a non-empty range of the [[Real numbers|real numbers]] is continuous if it can take on any value in that range.

this is because any range of real numbers between $a$ and $b$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{R};a\neq b$ is uncountable with an infinitely many values within the range.
