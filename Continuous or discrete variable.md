in mathematics and [[Statistics|statistics]], a quantitative [[Variables|variable]] may be **continuous** or **discrete** if they are obtained by *measuring*, or *counting* (respectively).

# Continuous variable

a continuous variable is a variable whose value is obtained by measuring, i.e. a variable which can take on an [[Uncountable set|uncountable set]] of values.

for example, a variable over a non-empty range of the [[Real numbers|real numbers]] is continuous if it can take on any value in that range.

this is because any range of real numbers between $a$ and $b$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{R};a\neq b$ is uncountable with an infinitely many values within the range.

in statistical theory, the [[Probability distribution|probability distributions]] of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of [[Probability density function (PDF)|probability density functions]].

## Discrete variable

in contrast, a variable is a discrete variable [["if and only if"|if and only if]] there exists a one-to-one correspondence between this variable and $\mathbb{N}$ (the [[Subset|set]] [[Natural numbers|of natural numbers]]).

meaning, a discrete variable within a certain range of real numbers is one where each allowed value is separated by a minimum distance from the next. 

you can find a discrete variable's value by counting, and the total number of possible values is either limited or countably infinite.
