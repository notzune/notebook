in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], the marginal distribution of a [[Subset|subset]] of a collection of [[Random variables|random variables]] is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset.

it gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference of the other variables.

this is in contrast with a [[Conditional probability distribution|conditional distribution]] which gives the probabilities dependent on the values of other variables.
