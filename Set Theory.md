## Basic concepts

set theory begins with a fundamental [[Binary relation|binary relation]] between an object $o$ and a set $A$. 

if $o$ is a member (or [[Element|element]]) of $A$, the [[Set theory notation|notation]] $o\in A$ is used.

a derived binary relation between two sets is the subset relation, also called set inclusion. if all the members of set $A$ are also members of set $B$, then $A$ is a [[Subset|subset]] of $B$, denoted $A\subseteq B$

for example, $\{1,2\}$ is a subset of $\{1,2,3\}$ and so is $\{2\}$ but $\{1,4\}$ is not.

as implied by its definition, a set is a subset of itself. for cases where this possibility would make sense to be rejected, the term [[Proper subset|proper subset]] is defined.

$A$ is called a [[Proper subset|proper subset]] of $B$ if and only if $A$ is a subset of $B$ but $A$ is not equal to $B$.
