in philosophy of logic and [[Logic|logic]], a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a [[Logical form|logical form]] consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or sometimes [[Multiple-conclusion logic|conclusions]]).

for example, the rule of inference called [[Modus ponens|modus ponens]] takes two premises, one in the form "if p then q" and another in the form "p", and returns the conclusion "q".

## Standard form

in formal logic, rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{Premise\#1} \\
&\text{Premise\#2} \\
&\dots \\
&\text{Premise\#$n$} \\
&\text{\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_} \\
&\text{Conclusion}
\end{align}
$$

this expression states that whenever in the course of some logical [[Derivation|derivation]] the given [[Premise|premises]] have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well.

in other words, during the [[Deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning process]], if the stated premise(s) ([[Antecedent|antecedent]]) are established, then the conclusion ([[Consequent|consequent]]) can be accepted as [[Logical truth|true]].

$$
\begin{align}
&A\rightarrow B \\
&A \\
&\text{\_\_\_\_\_\_\_} \\
&B
\end{align}
$$
