in mathematics, an expression is in closed form if it is formed with constants, variables and a [[Finite set|finite set]] of basic [[Function|functions]] connected by arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,$ and [[Exponentiation|integer powers]]) and [[Function composition|function composition]].

commonly, the allowed functions are $n$th root, [[Exponential function|exponential function]], [[Logarithmic functions|logarithm]], and [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric functions]]. 

however, the set of functions depends on the context.

the closed-form problem arises when new ways are introduced for specifying mathematical objects, such as [[Limit|limits]], [[Series|series]] and [[Integrals|integrals]]: the problem is to determine whether it's possible to express these objects using simpler, more direct expressions based on previously established mathematical operations.

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
