if $A_1,\dots,A_n$ is a [[Partition (probability theory)|partition]] of a [[Sample space|sample space]], then the [[Posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] of the events $A_i$ [[Conditional probability|conditional]] on an [[Events|event]] $B$ can be obtained from the [[Probability|probabilities]] $P(A_i)$ and $P(B|A_i)$ using the formula

$$
P(A_i|B)=\frac{P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}{\sum^n_{j=1}P(A_j)P(B|A_j)}
$$
