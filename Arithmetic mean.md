in mathematics and [[Statistics|statistics]], the arithmetic mean (or just the mean or average) is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.

a more formal definition is that the arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is equal to the sum of the numerical values of each observation, divided by the total number of observations.

for a data set consisting of the values $x_1,\dots,x_n$, the arithmetic mean is defined as

$$
\overline{x}=\frac{1}{n}(\sum^n_{i=1}x_i)=\frac{x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n}{n}
$$
