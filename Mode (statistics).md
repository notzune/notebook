in [[Statistics|stats]], the mode is the value that appears most often in a [[Sets|set]] of data values. if $X$ is a [[Continuous or discrete variable|discrete]] [[Random variables|random variable]], the mode is the value $x$ at which the [[Probability mass function (PMF)|probability mass function]] takes its maximum value; in other words **it is the value that is most likely to be sampled**.

$$
x=\arg\max_{x_i} P(X = x_i)
$$

like the [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]] and [[Median|median]], the mode is a way of expressing important information about a random variable or [[Statistical population|population]]. the value of the mode is the same as the of the mean and median in a [[Normal distribution|normal distribution]].
