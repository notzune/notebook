in mathematics, Pascal's rule is a [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] about [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]]. it states that for the positive [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] $n$ and $k$,

$$
\binom{n-1}{k}+\binom{n-1}{k-1}=\binom{n}{k}
$$

where $\binom{n}{k}$ is a binomial coefficient.
