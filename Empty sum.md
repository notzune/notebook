an empty sum is a summation where the number of terms is zero.

the natural way to extend non-empty sums is to let the empty sum be the [[Additive identity|additive identity]].

let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots$ by a sequence of numbers and let

$$
s_m=\sum^m_{i=1}a_i=a_1+\dots+a_m
$$

be the sum of the first $m$ terms of the sequence. this satisfies the [[Recurrence relation|recurrence]]

$$
s_m=s_{m-1}+a_m
$$
