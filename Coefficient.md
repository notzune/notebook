in math, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor involved in some term of a [[Polynomial|polynomial]], a [[Series|series]] or an expression. it may be a number ([[Dimensionless|dimensionless]]), in which case it is known as a numerical factor. it may also be a [[Constant|constant]] with units of measurement, in which it is known as a constant multiplier.

in general, coefficients may be any expression (including variables such as $a$, $b$, and $c$).

when the combination of variables and constants is not necessarily involved in a product, it may be called a [[Parameter|parameter]]. 

for example, the polynomial $2x^2-x+3$ has coefficients 2, -1, and 3, and the powers of the variable $x$ in the polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$ have coefficient parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$.

the ***constant coefficient***, also known as a ***constant term*** or simply the ***constant***, is the quantity not attached to variables in an expression. 

in the examples above, the constant coefficients are the number 3 and the variable $c$, respectively.

the coefficient attached to the highest degree of the variable in a polynomial is referred to as the ***leading coefficient***. 

in the examples above, the leading coefficients are 2 and $a$, respectively. 

in the context of [[Differential equations|differential equations]], we can set up the equation so that one side is zero and the other side includes a polynomial. 

this polynomial is made up of the functions we're trying to find and their derivatives. the coefficients in a differential equation are the multipliers of these functions and their derivatives, which can be functions themselves rather than just numbers.

a coefficient is a constant coefficient when it is a [[Constant function|constant function]]. to avoid confusion, the coefficient that is not attached to known functions and their derivative is a called the constant term rather than the constant coefficient.

in particular, in a [[Linear differential equations|linear differential equation with constant coefficient]], the constant term is generally not supposed to be a constant function.
