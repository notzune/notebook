in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|stats]], skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the [[Probability distribution|probability distribution of a real-values]] [[Random variables|random variable]] about its [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]]. the skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined.

for a [[Unimodality|unimodal]] distribution, negative skew indicates that the tail is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates the tail is on the right.

in cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule; for example a zero value in skewness means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall. this is the case for symmetric distributions but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short and fat. 

therefore, skewness should not be the judge of symmetry of a given distribution since the [[Shape of the distribution|distribution shape]] must be taken into account.

# Definitions

1. negative skew: the left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure. this distribution is considered *left-skewed*, *left-tailed*, or *skewed to the left*. left in this definition refers to the tail being on the left despite the graph appearing to be leaning to the right.
2. positive skew: the right tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure. this distribution is considered *right-skewed*, *right-tailed*, or *skewed to the right*. like the definition for left skewness, right in this definition refers to the tail being on the right despite the graph appearing to be leaning to the left.
