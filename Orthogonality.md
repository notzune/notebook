orthogonality is the generalization of the geometric notion of [[Perpendicularity|perpendicularity]] to the [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]] of [[Bilinear forms|bilinear forms]].

two elements, $u$ and $v$ of a [[Vector space|vector space]] with bilinear form $B$ are orthogonal when $B(u,v) = 0$.

depending on the bilinear form, the vector space may contain nonzero self-orthogonal [[Vectors|vectors]].

in the case of [[Function spaces|function spaces]] families of [[Orthogonal Functions|orthogonal functions]] are used to form a [[Basis|basis]].
