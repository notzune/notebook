in [[Logic|logic]], a categorical proposition (or categorical statement) is a [[Proposistion|proposition]] that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the subject term) are included in another (the predicate term).

the  study of [[Argument|arguments]] (such as [[Syllogism|syllogism]]) forms an important branch of [[Deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]] and has identified four primary distinct types of categorical proposition:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{All $S$ are $P$.}\space &\text{(A form.)}\space\space&\forall x[S_x\rightarrow P_x]\equiv\forall x[\neg S_x\vee P_x] \\
&\text{No $S$ are $P$.}\space &\text{(E form.)}\space\space&\forall x[S_x\rightarrow\neg P_x]\equiv\forall x[\neg S_x\vee\neg P_x] \\
&\text{Some $S$ are $P$.}\space &\text{(I form.)}\space\space&\exists x[S_x\wedge P_x] \\
&\text{Some $S$ are not $P$.}\space &\text{(O form.)}\space\space&\exists x[S_x\wedge\neg P_x] \\
\end{align}
