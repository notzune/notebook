the number $e$ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. it is the [[Limit|limit]] of $(1+\frac{1}{n})^{n}$ as $n$ approaches infinity, or it can be calculated as the sum of the infinite [[Series|series]]

$$
e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=1+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\cdot2}+\frac{1}{1\cdot2\cdot3}+\dots
$$

it is also the unique positive number $a$ such that the [[Graph|graph]] of the [[Function|function]] $y=a^{x}$ has a [[Slope|slope]] of 1 at $x=0$.
