in mathematics, a combination is a selection of items from a [[Sets|set]] that has distinct [[Element|members]], such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike [[Permutation|permutations]] where the order plays a role).

a combination of $k$ objects from $n$ objects ($n\geq k$) is an unordered collection of $k$ objects selected [[Replacement|without replacement]] (without repetition) from the group of $n$ objects.

the number of possible combinations of $k$ objects from $n$ objects is

$$
C^n_k=\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\space k!}
$$

for example, given three fruits (apple, orange, banana) there are three different combinations of two fruits (apple and orange, apple and banana, orange and banana).

if the set has $n$ elements, the number of $k$-combinations (denoted by $C(n,k)$ or $C^n_k$) is equal to the [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]].

combinations with replacement (in which repetition is allowed) would be referred to as $k$-combination with repetition, or $k$-[[Multiset|multiset]].
