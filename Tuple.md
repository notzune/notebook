in mathematics, a tuple is a finite [[Sequence|sequence]] or [[Enumeration|ordered list]] of numbers or any mathematical object, which are called elements of the tuple.

an $n$-tuple is a tuple of $n$ elements, where $n$ is a non-negative [[Integer|integer]].

there is only one $0$-tuple, called the empty tuple. a $1$-tuple and a $2$-tuple are commonly called a [[Singleton|singleton]] and [[Ordered pair|ordered pair]], respectively.

tuples may be formally defined from ordered pairs by [[Recurrence relation|recurrence]] by starting from ordered pairs, 
so an $n$-tuple can be identified with the ordered pair of its $(n-1)$ first elements and its $n$th element.
