in [[Object-Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]], an instance is a concrete occurrence of any [[Object (computer science)|object]], existing usually during the runtime of a computer program.

in java, using the `new` operator will create a new instance of an object class.

for example, we can [[Decleration (computer science)|declare]] an object ([[Foobar|foobar]]) as a variable

```java
// here we are declaring a variable

Object foo;
```

and then instantiate it (create a new instance) of it.

```java 
// and here we are instantiating it

foo = new Object(bar);
```
