in [[Object-Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]], an instance is a concrete occurrence of any [[Object (computer science)|object]], existing usually during the runtime of a computer program.

in java, using the `new` operator will create a new instance of an object class.

for example, we can [[Decleration (computer science)|declare]] an object as a variable

```java
\\ here we are declaring a variable

String title;

\\ and here we are instantiating it

title = new String("some string");
```
