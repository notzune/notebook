in [[Set theory|set theory]], the universal set describes the [[Sets|set]] containing all objects or [[Element|elements]] under discussion and of which all other sets are [[Subset|subsets]].

to denote that some element $x$ is contained in the universal set, we can denote it as $x\in U$ where $U$ denotes the universal set.
