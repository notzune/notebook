in mathematics, function application is the act of applying a [[Function|function]] to an argument from its [[Domain|domain]] so as to obtain the corresponding value from its [[Range|range]]. 

in this sense, function application can be thought of as the opposite of function [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]].
