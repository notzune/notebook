an identity function, also called an identity [[Relations|relation]], identity map or identity transformation, is a [[Function|function]] that always returns the value that we used as its [[Argument of a function|argument]], unchanged.

that is when $f$ is the identity function, the [[Equality|equality]] $f(X) = X$ is true for all values of $X$ to which $f$ can be applied.

formally, if $M$ is a set, the identity function $f$ on $M$ is defined to be a function with $M$ as its [[Domain|domain]] and [[Codomain|codomain]] satisfying:

$$
f(X)=X\space\forall X\in M
$$

the function value $f(X)$ in the codomain $M$ is always the same as the input element $X$ in the domain $M$.

the identity function $f$ on $M$ is an [[Injective functions|injective function]] as well as a [[Surjective functions|surjective function]], so it is [[Bijection|bijective]].

this identity function $f$ on $M$ is often denoted by $\text{id}_{M}$.

in [[Set Theory|set theory]], where a function is defined as a particular kind of [[Binary relation|binary relation]], the identity function is given by the [[Homogeneous Relation|identity relation]], or diagonal of $M$.
