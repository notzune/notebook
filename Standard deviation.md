in [[Statistics|statistics]], the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a [[Random variables|random variable]] expected about its [[Mean|mean]].

a low standard [[Deviation|deviation]] means that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the [[Expected value|expected value]]) of the [[Sets|set]],

while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

the standard deviation of a random variable, sample, statistical population, data set, or [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] is the square root of its [[Variance|variance]].

the sample mean's standard error is the standard deviation of the set of means that would be found by drawing an infinite number of repeated samples from the population and computing a mean for each sample.
