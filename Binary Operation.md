a binary operation, or dyadic operation, is a rule for combining two [[Element|elements]] (called [[Operand|operands]]) to produce another element.

a binary operation is an [[Operation|operation]] with an [[Arity|arity]] of two.

a binary operation on a [[Sets|set]] is a binary operation whose two [[Domain|domains]] and the [[Codomain|codomain]] are the same set.

examples include the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication; as well as other examples such as [[Vector addition|vector addition]], [[Matrix multiplication|matrix multiplication]] and [[Conjugacy class|conjugation in groups]].

an operation of arity two that involved several sets is also called a binary operation.

for example, [[Scalar multiplication|scalar multiplication]] of [[Vector space|vector spaces]] takes a [[Scalar|scalar]] and a [[Vectors|vector]] to produce a vector, and [[Scalar product|scalar product]] takes two vectors to produce a scalar.

such operations are also referred to as [[Binary functions|binary functions]].

## Definition

more formally, a binary operation on a set $S$ is a mapping of the elements of the [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian product]] $S\times S$ to $S$.

$$
f:S\times S\rightarrow S
$$

the [[Closure|closure property]] of a binary operation asserts the existence of a result for the operation given any pair of operands.

if $f$ is not a [[Function|function]] but a [[Partial function|partial function]], then $f$ is called a partial binary operation. 

for example, division of [[Real numbers|real numbers]] is a partial binary operation because division by 0 is impossible (or rather it's undefined) for every real number $a$.  

in [[Abstract algebra|abstract algebra]], "$*$" can be used to denote an arbitrary binary operation such as multiplication or addition. in this case "$*$" is used as a placeholder. (see: [[* (operation)]])
