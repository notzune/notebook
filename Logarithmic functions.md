the logarithm is the [[Inverse functions|inverse function]] to [[Exponentiation|exponentiation]]. the logarithm of a number $x$ to the [[Base|base]] $b$ is the [[Exponent|exponent]] to which $b$ must be raised to produce $x$.

the logarithm of $x$ to base $b$ is denoted as

$$
\log_{b}(x)
$$

for example, since $10^{3}=1000$, the logarithm base $10$ of $1000$ is $3$, or $\log_{10}(1000)=3$.

the logarithm base $10$ is called the decimal or common log. the [[Natural logarithm|natural log]] has the [[e (constant)|number]] $e\approx2.718$ as its base. the [[Binary logarithm|binary logarithm]] uses base $2$ and is often used in [[Computer science|computer science]].
