in [[Logic|logic]] specifically in [[Deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]], an argument is valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be [[False (logic)|false]]. 

it is not required for a valid argument to have [[Premise|premises]] that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion.

valid arguments must be clearly expressed through sentences called "[[Well-formed formulas|well formed formulas]]" (also called *wffs*).

the validity of an argument can be tested, proved or disproved, and depends on its [[Logical form|logical form]].
