the photovoltaic effect is the generation of voltage and [[Electric current|electric current]] in a material upon exposure to light. it is a physical phenomenon.

the photovoltaic effect is closely related to the [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric effect]]. 

for both, light is absorbed, causing excitation of an [[Electrons|electron]] or other [[Charge carrier|charge carrier]] to a higher-energy state. 

the main difference is that the term photoelectric effect is now usually used when the electron is ejected out of the material (usually into a vacuum) and photovoltaic effect is used when the excited charge carrier is still contained within the material.

in either case, an [[Electric potential|electric potential]] (or voltage) is produced by the separation of charges, and the light has to have a sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for excitation. 

the physical essence of the difference is usually that photoelectric emission separates the charges by [[Ballistic conduction|ballistic conduction]] and photovoltaic emission separates them by diffusion, but some "hot carrier" photovoltaic devices concepts blur this distinction.
