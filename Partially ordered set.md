in math, specifically [[Order theory|order theory]], a partial order on a [[Sets|set]] is an arrangement such that, for certain pairs of [[Element|elements]], one precedes the other.

the word partial is used to indicate that not every piar of elements needs to be comparable, meaning that there may be pairs where neither of the elements precede each other.

formally, a partial order is a [[Homogeneous relation|homogeneous binary relation]] that is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
