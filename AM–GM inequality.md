the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM inequality) states that the [[Arithmetic mean|arithmetic mean]] of a list of non-negative [[Real numbers|real numbers]] is greater than or equal to the [[Geometric mean|geometric mean]] of the same list.

the two means are equal [["if and only if"|if and only if]] every number in the list is the same (in which case they are both the same number)

the simplest case would be something like

$$
\frac{x+y}{2}\geq\sqrt{xy}
$$

with equality if and only if $x=y$. this can be seen from the fact that the square of a real number is always non-negative and from the case of the [[Binomial theorem|binomial formula:]]

$$
(a\pm b)^2=a^2\pm2ab+b^2
$$
$$
\begin{align}
0&\leq(x-y)^2 \\
&=x^2-2xy+y^2 \\
&=x^2+2xy+y^2-4xy \\
&=(x+y)^2-4xy \\
\end{align}
$$
