given two integers $a$ and $b$, with $b \neq 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that:

$$
\begin{align*}
a = bq + r \\
0 \le r < |b| \\
\end{align*}
$$
in the above theorem, each of the four integers has a name of its own: $a$ is called the *dividend*, $b$ is called the *divisor*, $q$ is called the *quotient* and $r$ is called the *remainder*.
