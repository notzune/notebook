is a form of [[Instruction set architecture (ISA)|instruction set]] designed for efficient execution by a software [[Interpreter|interpreter]]. unlike human-readable [[Source code|source code]], bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of a [[Compiler|compiler]] parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope and nesting depths of program objects.
