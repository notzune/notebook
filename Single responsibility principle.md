the single responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that "a module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor." 

the term actor refers to a group (consisting of one or more stakeholders or users) that requires a change in the module.

in other words, the SRP states that "a [[Class (computer programming)|class]] should have only one reason to change"
