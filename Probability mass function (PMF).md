in [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[statistics]], a probability mass function is a [[function]] that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. 

sometimes it is also known as the discrete probability density function.

the probability mass function is used in defining a [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete probability distribution]] and such functions exist for either [[scalar]] or multivariate random variables whose [[domain]] is discrete.

formally, it is the function $p:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow[0,1]$ defined by

$$
p_X(x)=P(X=x)
$$

for $-\infty<x<\infty$, where $P$ is a [[Probability measure|probability measure]].
