a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a mathematical [[Sequence|sequence]] of non-zero numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio.

for example, the sequence $2,6,18,54,\dots$ is a geometric progression with common ratio $3$. 

similarly $10,5,2,5,1,1.25,\dots$ is a geometric sequence with the common ratio $1/2$.
