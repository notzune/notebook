in math, a continuous function is a [[Function|function]] such that a small variation of the [[Argument of a function|argument]] induces a small variation of the value of the function.

this implies there are no abrupt changes in value, known as [[Classification of discontinuities|discontinuities]]. 

the [[Epsilon-delta definition of a limit|epsilon-delta definition of a limit]] was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.
