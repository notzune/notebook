the modulus has a number of different definitions based on the context:

1. the factor by which a logarithm of a number to one base is multiplied to obtain the logarithm of the number to a new base
2. the number (such as a positive integer) or other mathematical entity (such as a polynomial) in a congruence that divides the difference of the two congruent members without leaving a remainder
3. a constant or coefficient that expresses usually numerically the degree to which a body or substance possesses a particular property (such as elasticity)
4. base of modular arithmetic
5. the absolute value of a real or complex number ($|a|$)
