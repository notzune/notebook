all regular [[Operation Identities|operation identities]] hold true for set operations when considering (for sake of argument and simplicity) that:

- $\cup$ (union) behaves the same way as addition
- $\cap$ (intersection) behaves similarly to multiplication
- $\setminus$ (set difference) behaves similarly to subtraction

this being said we are introduced to the identities of set operations:

- [[Associativity of Sets]]
- [[Commutativity of Sets]]
- [[Distributive Laws of Sets]]
- [[Identity Elements of Sets]]
