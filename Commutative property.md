a [[Binary operation|binary operation]] is commutative if changing the order of the [[Operand|operands]] does not change the result.

## Definitions

a binary operation $*$ on a [[Sets|set]] $S$ is called commutative if

$$
x*y=y*x\space\forall x,y\in S
$$

in other words, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute. an operation that does not satisfy the above property is called non-commutative.
