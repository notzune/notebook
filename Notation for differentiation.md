in [[Differential calculus|differential calculus]], there is no single uniform notation for differentiation. instead, various notations for the [[Derivative|derivative]] of a [[Function|function]] are or variable have been proposed. the usefulness of each notation varies with the context, and it is sometimes useful to use more than one notation in a given context.

## [[Leibniz's notation]]

is most common when the equation $y=f(x)$ is regarded as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables $y$ and $x$. 

this is explicitly shown by Leibniz's notation

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

the derivative of $f$ at $x$ is therefore written

$$
\frac{df}{dx}(x)\text{ or }\frac{df(x)}{dx}\text{ or }\frac{d}{dx}f(x)
$$
