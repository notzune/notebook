the slope or gradient of a [[Line|line]] is a number that describes both the *direction* and the *steepness* of the line. 

slope is often denoted by the letter $m$ and is used in the equation of a straight [[Line|line]]:

$$
y=mx+b
$$

slope is calculated by finding the ratio if the "vertical change" or the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line. sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient ("rise over run"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line.

the steepness, incline or grade of a line is measured by the [[Absolute value|absolute value]] of the slope. a slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. the direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical.

- a line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. the slope is positive ($m>0$)
- a line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. the slope is negative ($m<0$)
- if a line is horizontal the slope is zero. this is a [[Constant function|constant function]].
- if a line is vertical the slope is undefined

the slope $m$ of the line is 

$$
m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
$$
