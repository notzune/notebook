in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], a sequence of [[Independence|independent]] [[Bernoulli trial|Bernoulli trials]] with probability $1/2$ of success on each trial is metaphorically called a fair coin.

if the probability is not $1/2$, this is referred to as a **biased coin**.

a fair coin is defined as the [[Probability space|probability space]] ($\Omega,\mathcal{F},P$), using $H$ for heads and $T$ for tails, the [[Sample space|sample space]] of a coin is defined as:

$$
\Omega=\{H,T\}
$$

and the event space for a coin includes all [[Sets|sets]] of outcomes from the sample space which can be assigned a [[Probability|probability]], which is the full [[Power sets|power set]] $2^{\Omega}$.

$$
\mathcal{F}=\{\{\},\{H\},\{T\},\{H,T\}\}
$$

where $\{\}$ is the [[Empty set|empty set]] and the event that neither outcome happens (which is impossible and therefore can be assigned to have a probability of $0$), and where $\{H,T\}$ is the event where either outcome happens (which is guaranteed and can be assigned $1$ probability).
