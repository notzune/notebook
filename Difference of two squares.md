in mathematics, the difference of two squares is a squared (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number.

every difference of squares may be factored according to the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]

$$
a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)
$$

# Proof

starting from the right-hand side, apply the [[Distributive property|distributive law]]

$$
(a+b)(a-b)=a^2+ba-ab-b^2
$$

by the [[Commutative property|commutative law]] the middle two terms cancel

$$
ba-ab=0
$$
leaving

$$
(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2
$$

this also gives a simple proof of the [[AMâ€“GM inequality]] in two variables

this proof holds in any [[Commutative ring|commutative ring]].

if this identity holds in a [[Rings|ring]] $R$ for all pairs of elements $a$ and $b$, then $R$ is commutative. to see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the equation and get

$$
a^2+ba-ab-b^2
$$

for this to be equal to $a^2-b^2$, we must have

$$
ba-ab=0
$$

for all pairs $a$, $b$, so $R$ is commutative.
