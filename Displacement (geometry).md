preserves [[Distance|distances]] and [[Angle|angles]]. a [[Translation|translation]] is a type of displacement.

more formally, a displacement is a vector whose length is the shortest distance of the original and final position of a point $P$ in [[Motion (geometry)|motion]].

it quantifies both the direction and the distance of the net or total motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point trajectory. 

a displacement may be identified with the [[Translation|translation]] that maps the initial position to the final position.
