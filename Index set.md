an index set is a [[Sets|set]] whose [[Element|members]] label (or index) members of another set.

for example, if the elements of a set $A$ may be indexed or labeled by means of the elements of a set $J$, then $J$ is an index set.

the indexing consists of a [[Surjective functions|surjective function]] from $J$ onto $A$, and the indexed collecetion is called an [[Indexed family|indexed family]], often written as $\{A_j\}_{j\in J}$

## Examples

an [[Enumeration|enumeration]] of a set $S$ gives an index set $J\subset\mathbb{N},\text{ where } f:J\rightarrow S$ is the particular enumeration of $S$.

any countably infinite set can be ([[Injective functions|injectively]]) indexed by the set of [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$.

for $r\in\mathbb{R}$, the [[Indicator function|indicator function]] on $r$ is the function $1_r:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ given by

$$
1_r(x) := 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } x \neq r \\
1, & \text{if } x = r
\end{cases}
