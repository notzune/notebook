in [[Computing|computing]], a word is the natural unit of data used by a particular [[CPU|processor]] design. a word is a fixed-sized [[Data (computer science)|datum]] handled as a unit by the [[Instruction set architecture (ISA)|instruction set]] or the hardware of the processor.

the number of [[Bit|bits]] or digits in a word (the word size, word width, or word length) is an important characteristic of any specific processor design or [[Computer architecture|computer architecture]].

the size of a word is reflected in many aspects of a computer's structure and operation; the majority of the [[Processor register|registers]] in a processor are usually word-sized and the largest datum that can be transferred to and from the [[Computer memory|working memory]] in a single operation is a word in many (not all) architectures.

the largest possible [[Memory address|address]] size, used to designate a location in memory, is typically a hardware word (the full-sized natural word of the processor)
