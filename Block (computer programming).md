in [[Computer programming|computer programming]], a block, or code block or a block of code, is a lexical structure of [[Source code|source code]] which is grouped together. 

blocks consist of one or more [[Declaration (computer science)|declarations]] and [[Statement (computer science)|statements]].

block have two functions: to group statements so that they can be treated as one statement, and to define scopes for names to distinguish them from the same name used elsewhere.

the [[Object (computer science)|objects]] named in outer blocks are visible inside inner blocks, unless they are masked by an object declared with the same name.
