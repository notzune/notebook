if all [[Outcome|outcomes]] are equally likely, an experiment may be considered "fair". 

for example, a "fair" [[Fair coin|coin]] has two [[Events|events]] of equal [[Probability|probability]] (heads and tails), while a "fair" six-sided [[Dice (die)|dice roll]] has the equal probability of resulting in one of six events, each with a probability of $1/6$.
