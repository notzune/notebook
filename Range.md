the range of a function may refer to either of two related concepts:
- the [[Codomain|codomain]] of the function, or
- the [[Image|image]] of the function.

in some cases the codomain and the image of a function are the same set; such a function is called [[Surjective functions|surjective]] or *onto*.

for any non-surjective function $f : X\rightarrow Y$, the codomain $Y$ and the image $\tilde{Y}$ are different; however, a new function can be defined with the original function's image as its codomain:

$$
\tilde{f}:X\rightarrow\tilde{Y}\text{ where }\tilde{f}(x)=f(x)
$$
this new function is surjective.

given two sets $X$ and $Y$, a [[Binary relation|binary relation]] $f$ between $X$ and $Y$ isa. function ($X\rightarrow Y$) if for every element $x$ in $X$ there is exactly one $y$ in $Y$ such that $f$ relates $x$ to $y$.

the sets $X$ and $Y$ are called the [[Domain|domain]] and [[Codomain|codomain]] respectively. the [[Image|image]] of a function $f$ is the [[Subset|subset]] of $Y$ consisting of only those elements $y$ of $Y$ such that there is at least one $x$ in $X$ with $f(x)=y$.
