in [[Algebra|algebra]], a binomial is a [[Polynomial|polynomial]] that is the sum of two terms, each of which is a [[Monomial|monomial]]. 

a binomial takes the form of 

$$
ax^m-bx^n
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are numbers, and $m$ and $n$ are distinct non-negative [[Integer|integers]] and $x$ is a symbol which is called an [[Indeterminate|indeterminate]] or more commonly a [[Variables|variable]].

more generally it can be written as

$$
ax_1^{n_1}\dots x_i^{n_i}-bx_1^{m_1}\dots x_i^{m_i}
$$
