in [[Statistics|statistics]], a multimodal distribution is a [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] with more than one [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] (more than one local peak of the distribution). these appear as distinct peaks in the [[Probability density function (PDF)|probability density function]]. 

when the two modes are unequal, the larger mode is known as the major mode and the other as the minor mode. the least frequent value between the modes is known as the antimode. the difference between the two (major and minor) modes is known as the [[Amplitude|amplitude]].

# Galtung's classification (AJUS)

i'm not sure if this will ever show up on a test but I stumbled across this and I like how easy it is. 

- A: unimodal distribution - peak in the middle
- J: unimodal - peak at either end
- U: bimodal - peaks at both ends
- S: bimodal or multimodal - multiple peaks

there's also a modified version:

- J: unimodal - peak on right
- L: unimodal - peak on left
- F: no peak (flat)
