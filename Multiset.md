in mathematics and [[Set theory|set theory]], a multiset (or bag, or mset) is a modification of the concept of a [[Sets|set]] that, unlike a set allows for multiple instances for each of its [[Element|elements]].

the number of instances given for each element is called the [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]] of that element in the multiset.

as a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist which contain only elements $a$ and $b$, but vary in the multiplicities of their elements:

- in the set $\{a,b\}$ contains only elements $a$ and $b$, each having multiplicity 1
- in the multiset $\{a,a,b\}$, the element $a$ has a multiplicity of 2 and $b$ has a multiplicity  of 1
- in the multiset $\{a,a,a,b,b,b\}$, $a$ and $b$ both have a multiplicity of 3

as with sets but in contrast to [[Tuple|tuples]], the order of the elements do not matter so $\{a,a,b\}$ and $\{a,b,a\}$ describe the same multiset.

the [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of a multiset is the sum of the multiplicities of all its elements.

for example, in the multiset $\{a,a,b,b,b,c\}$ the multiplicities of $a, b$ and $c$ are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. therefore, the cardinality is 6 since 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.
