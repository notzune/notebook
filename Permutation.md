in mathematics, a permutation of a [[Sets|set]] is an arrangement of its [[Element|members]] into a [[Sequence|sequence]] or a [[Total order|linear order]], or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements.

the study of permutations of [[Finite set|finite sets]] is an important topic in [[Combinatorics|combinatorics]] and [[Group theory|group theory]].

in [[Computer science|computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[Sorting algorithms|sorting algorithms]].

the number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects is $n$ [[Factorial|factorial]], usually written as $n!$, which means the product of all positive [[Integer|integers]] less than or equal to $n$.

formally, a permutation of a set $S$ is defined as a [[Bijection|bijection]] from $S$ to itself.

that is, it is a [[Function|function]] from $S$ to $S$ for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[Image|image]] value.

such a function $f:S\rightarrow S$ is equivalent to the rearrangement of the elements of $S$ in which each element $i$ is replaced by the corresponding $f(i)$. 

for example, the permutation (3,1,2) is described by the function $\sigma$ defined as 

$$
f(1)=3,\space f(2)=1,\space f(3)=2
$$

the collection of all permutations of a set form a [[Group|group]] called the [[Symmetric group|symmetric group]] of the set.

the group operation is the [[Function composition|composition]] of functions (performing one rearrangement after the other), which results in another function (rearrangement).
