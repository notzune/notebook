a base is a substance that can accept a [[Hydrogen ion|hydrogen ion]] (H+) from another substance. a chemical can accept a [[Protons|proton]] if it has a [[Electric charge|negative charge]], or if the molecule has an [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom like [[Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]], or [[Chlorine|chlorine]] that is rich in electrons.

like [[Acid|acids]], some bases are strong and others are weak. the weak bases are less likely to accept protons, while the strong bases quickly take protons in solution or from other molecules.

an acid is a base's "chemical opposite", an acid is a substance that will donate a hydrogen atom to the base.

bases have a [[pH]] greater than 7.0. weak bases generally have a pH value of 7—9 while strong bases have a a pH value of 9—14.

bases can be used to neutralize acids.wWhen a base, often OH$^-$, accepts a proton from an acid, it forms a [[Water|water]] molecule which is harmless. 

when all of the acids and bases react to form water molecules and other neutral [[Salt|salts]], it is called neutralization. acids can also be used to neutralize bases.

- bitter taste (opposed to sour taste of acids)
- slimy, or soapy feel on fingers (slippery)
- many bases react with acids and [[Precipitation|precipitate]] salts.
- strong bases may react violently with acids. an acid spill can be safely neutralized by using a mild base.
- bases turn red [[Litmus paper|litmus paper]] blue
- bases are substances that contain metal oxides or hydroxides
- bases which are soluble in water form alkalis (soluble bases)
