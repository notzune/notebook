in [[Logic|logic]] and mathematics (such as [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]]), the converse of a categorical or implicational statement is the result of reversing its two constituent statements. for the [[Implication|implication]] $P\rightarrow Q$, the converse is $Q\rightarrow P$, 

for the [[Categorical proposition|categorical proposition]]: all $S$ are $P$, the converse is all $P$ are $S$.

the truth of the converse is generally independent from that of the original statement.

let $S$ be a statement of the form 

$$
P\implies Q
$$

then the converse of $S$ is the statement

$$
Q\implies P
$$

in general, the truth of $S$ says nothing about the truth of its converse, unless the [[Antecedent|antecedent]] $P$ and the [[Consequent|consequent]] $Q$ are logically equivalent. 

for example, consider the true statement "if i am a human, then i am a mortal" and consider its converse "if i am a mortal, then i am a human" which is not necessarily [[Logical truth|true]].
