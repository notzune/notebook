dynamic random-access memory (dynamic RAM or DRAM) is a type of [[RAM|random-access semiconductor memory]] that stores each [[Bit|bit]] of data in a [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]], usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, both typically based on metal-oxide-semiconductor ([[MOSFET|MOS]]) technology.

while most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors.

in the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1.
