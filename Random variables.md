a random variable is any quantity or object that depends on random events. the term is misleading because its mathematical definition is not actually random or a variable, it is a [[Function|function]] from possible [[Outcome|outcomes]] (such as a coin flip, i.e. heads $H$ and $T$ tails) in a [[Sample space|sample space]] (e.g., the set $\{H,T\}$) to a measurable space (e.g., $\{1,-1\}$ in which 1 is $H$ and -1 is $T$) 

## Definition

formally, a random variable $X$ is a measurable function $X:\Omega\rightarrow E$ from a sample space $\Omega$ as a [[Sets|set]] of possible outcomes to a measurable space $E$.

the probability that $X$ takes on a value in a measurable set $S\subseteq E$ is written as

$$
P(X\in S)=P(\{\omega\in\Omega|X(\omega)\in S\})
$$

in many cases, $X$ is [[Real numbers|real]]-valued ($E=\mathbb{R}$). 

in other words, a random variable is obtained by assigning a numerical value to each outcome of a particular experiment.
