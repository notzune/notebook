in [[Set theory|set theory]], and the branches of [[Logic|logic]], mathematics, and [[Computer science|computer science]] that it, the axiom of pairing is one of the [[Axiom|axioms]] of [[Zermelo set theory|elementary set theory]].

formally, [[Universal quantifier|given any]] object $A$ and any object $B$, [[Existential quantifier|there is]] a set $C$ such that, given any object $D$, $D$ is a member of $C$ [["if and only if"|if and only if]] $D$ is equal to $A$ [[Logical disjunction|or]] $D$ is equal to $B$.

or in other words, given two objects there is a [[Sets|set]] whose [[Element|elements]] are exactly the two given objects.
