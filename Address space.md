in [[computing|computing]], an address space defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a [[Host (network)|network host]], [[Peripheral|peripheral device]], [[Disk sector|disk sector]], a [[Computer data storage|memory cell]] or other logical or physical entity.

for [[Computer program|software programs]] to save and retrieve stored [[Data (computer science)|data]], each datum must have an address where it can be located. 

the number of address spaces available depends on the underlying address structure, which is usually limited by the computer architecture being used. 

often an address space in a system with [[Virtual memory|virtual memory]] corresponds to a highest level translation table.
