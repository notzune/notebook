in mathematics, an argument of a [[Function|function]] is a value provided to obtain the function's result. also known as an [[Independent Variable|independent variable]].

the number of arguments that a function takes is called the [[Arity|arity]] of the function. a function that takes a single argument as an input, such as $f(x)=x^{2}$, is called a [[Unary Operation|unary function]]. a function of two or more variables is considered to have a [[Domain|domain]] consisting of ordered pairs or [[Tuple|tuples]] of argument values.

the argument of a [[Circular functions|circular function]] is an [[Angle|angle]]. the argument of a [[Hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic function]] is a [[Hyperbolic angle|hyperbolic angle]].

sometimes, subscripts can be used to denote arguments for example, we can use subscripts to denote the arguments with respect to which [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]] are taken.
