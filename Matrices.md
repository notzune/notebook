a rectangular array or table of objects (numbers, symbols, or expressions) arranged in rows and columns used to show relations between sets or subsets.

matrices are visual/graphical representations of [[Cartesian product|cartesian products]] and can be used to show [[Relation|relations]] and [[Equivalence relation|equivalence relations]]. 

here is the basic notation of a matrix:

$$
A \times B = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_{12} & ... & a_{1n} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} & ... & a_{2n} \\
    a_{31} & a_{32} & ... & a_{3n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    a_{m1} & a_{m2} & ... & a_{mn}\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

here we can see the columns marked by an $m$ and the rows marked by an $n$. 

a matrix is referred to by its cardinality, for example a matrix that is $m$ columns by $n$ rows is referred to as an $m \times n$ matrix.

matrices are also the result of multiplying two sets together and can simply be referred to by its sets such as $AA, BB, AB, A\times B, ..., etc$
