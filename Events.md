in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], an event is a [[Sets|set]] of possible outcomes. 

an event $A$ is a [[Subset|subset]] of the [[Sample space|sample space]] $S$. 

the [[Probability|probability]] of an event $A$ (usually denoted as $P(A)$), is obtained by summing the probabilities of the outcomes contained within the event $A$.

this figure shows a sample space $S$ consisting of eight outcomes, each of which labeled with a probability value. three of the outcomes are contained within the event $A$. the probability of event $A$ is calculated as the sum of the probabilities of these three events so that

$$
P(A)=0.10+0.15+0.30=0.55
$$

a general rule is that the sum of the probability of the event and its [[Complement (probability)|complement]] is:

$$
P(A)+P(A')=1
$$
