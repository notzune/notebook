in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], a Bernoulli trial (or binomial trial) is a random experiment with exactly two possible [[Outcome|outcomes]]; "success" and "failure".

you can think of this as a [[Boolean|boolean]].

one has the following [[Relation|relations]]:

$$
\begin{align}
p=1-q,&&q=1-p,&&p+q=1
\end{align}
$$

where $p$ is the probability of success in a trial, and $q$ is the probability of failure.
