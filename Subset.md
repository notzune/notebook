in [[Set theory|set theory]], subsets are [[Sets|sets]] within sets. if $X$ is a subset of $Y$ that means $X \in Y$ or more accurately $X\subseteq Y$, inversely this makes $Y$ the superset of $X$, denoted as $Y\supseteq X$. 

for example let's say that we have a set $X$ as defined:

$$
X = \{a,b,c\}
$$

we can split up this larger set into its smaller subsets:

$$
\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{a,c\},...,etc
$$

as well as it's [[Empty set|empty set]]: 

$$
\emptyset
$$

the [[Power sets|power set]] of $X$ then would be:

$$
\mathcal{P}({X})=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{b,a\},\{a,c\},\{c,a\},\{b,c\},\{c,b\},\{a,b,c\},\emptyset\}
$$

here are a few constant sets:

$$
\mathbb{P} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}
$$

where:

- $\mathbb{P}$ (or, $\mathbb{Z}^+$) - is the set of all positive integers
- $\mathbb{N}$ - is the set of all non negative integers
- $\mathbb{Z}$ - set of all [[Integer|integers]], ($\mathbb{Z}^-$ is also used to represent negative integers)
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - set of all rational numbers
- $\mathbb{R}$ - set of all [[Real numbers|real numbers]]
- $\mathbb{C}$ - set of all [[Complex numbers|complex numbers ]]
