subsets are sets within sets. if $X$ is a subset of $Y$ that means $X \in Y$ or more accurately $X \subseteq Y$

for example let's say that we have a set $X$ as defined:

$$X = \{a,b,c\}$$
we can split up this larger set into its smaller subsets:

$$ \{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{a,c\},...,etc$$
as well as it's [[Empty Set|empty set]]: $$\emptyset$$
the [[Power Sets|power set]] of $X$ then would be:
$$\mathcal{P} ({X}) = \{\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{b,a\},\{a,c\},\{c,a\},\{b,c\},\{c,b\},\{a,b,c\},\emptyset\}$$

here are a few constant sets:

$$
\mathbb{P} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}
$$
where:

- $\mathbb{P}$ - is the set of all positive integers
- $\mathbb{N}$ - is the set of all non negative integers
- $\mathbb{Z}$ - set of all integers
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - set of all rational numbers
- $\mathbb{R}$ - set of all real numbers
- $\mathbb{C}$ - set of all complex numbers
