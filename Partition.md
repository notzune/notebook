in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of a [[Sample space|sample space]] is a sequence $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ of [[Disjoint event|mutually exclusive]] [[Events|events]] for which 

$$
A_1\cup\dots\cup A_n=S
$$

each outcome in the sample space is then contained within one and only one of the events $A_i$.

in other words, a partition is a [[Sets|set]] of [[Disjoint sets|pairwise disjoint]] [[Events|events]] whose [[Union of events|union]] is the entire sample space.
