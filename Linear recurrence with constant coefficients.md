in mathematics (including [[Combinatorics|combinatorics]], [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]], and [[Dynamical system|dynamical systems]]), a linear recurrence with constant coefficients (also known as a linear [[Recurrence relation|recurrence relation]], or linear difference equation) involves creating an equation where a polynomial is set to zero. 

this polynomial is simple in form, only involving terms that are constants or multiples of the variable, which represents the successive terms of a sequence. 

in other words, the polynomial is linear because each term is either a constant (degree 0) or the variable itself (degree 1), without higher powers like squares or cubes.

a linear recurrence describes how a sequence of numbers progresses over discrete time steps or periods. 

the term "$t$" typically represents the current position in the sequence, "$t âˆ’ 1$" represents the position one step before, "$t + 1$" the position one step after, and so on. 

this kind of recurrence is used to model situations where each new term in a sequence is determined by a fixed, linear combination of previous terms.
