logical consequence (or entailment) is a fundamental concept in [[Logic|logic]] which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements.

a [[Validity|valid]] logical [[Argument|argument]] is one in which the [[Consequent|conclusion]] is entailed by the [[Premise|premises]] because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises.

logical consequences rely heavily on [[Logical form|schemes]] using [[Rule of inferences|inference rules]] such as:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{All $X$ are $Y$} \\
&\text{All $Y$ are $Z$} \\
&\text{Therefore, all $X$ are $Z$} \\
\end{align}
$$

this argument is formally valid, because every instance of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid.(?)
