in [[Computer science|computer science]], an object can be a [[Variable (computer science)|variable]], a [[Data structure|data structure]], a [[Function (computer programming)|function]], or a [[Function (computer programming)#Definition of a Method ( Object-Oriented Programming OOP )|method]].

in [[Class-based programming|class-based]] [[Programming paradigm|programming paradigms]] (such as [[Java]]), an *object* refers to a particular [[Instance (computer programming)|instance]] of a [[Class (computer programming)|class]].

in [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]] [[Programming language|languages]], an object is an [[Abstract data type|abstract data type]] with the addition of [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] and [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]]

an object consists of two main parts: the *state* (data; the instance; or specifically its [[Instance variable|instance variables]]) and *behavior* (code; function).

as regions of [[Computer memory|memory]], objects contain a [[Value (computer science)|value]] and can be referenced by an [[Identifier (computer languages)|identifier]], which will then copy its [[Memory address|address]].
