the associative property is a property of some [[Binary operation|binary operations]] which means that rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result. in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], associativity is a [[Validity|valid]] [[Rule of replacement|rule of replacement]] for expressions in [[Formal proof|logical proofs]].

within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator (additions or multiplication) the order in which the [[Operation|operations]] are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the [[Operand|operands]] is not changed.

meaning that rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value:

$$
\begin{align}
(2+3)+4=2+(3+4)=9 \\
\\
2\times(3\times 4)=(2\times 3)\times 4=24 \\
\end{align}
$$

even though the parentheses were rearranged, the values of the expressions were unchanged. this is the basis of the [[Associativities of addition and multiplication|associativities of addition and multiplication]].
