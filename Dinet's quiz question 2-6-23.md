Blimp is a billionaire. in the last 50 years he has paid taxes only once. chances of being audited in any given year are 1 out of 10 for ordinary residents and 1 out of 100 for billionaires. once you get audited, your chances of going to prison are 1 out of 100 if you have paid taxes that year, and 1 out of 10 if you have not.

the probability $P$ of him paying his taxes $T$ in 2024 based on his record so far is given to us as $P(T)=1/50$, the [[Complement (probability)|complement]] of this event would therefore be $P(\overline{T})=49/50$; the rest is given from the problem:

$$
\begin{align}
&P(T)=\text{chance that Blimp pays taxes}=1/50 \\
&P(\overline{T})=\text{chance that Blimp doesn't pay}=49/50 \\
\\
&P(A)=\text{chance to get audited}
\begin{cases}
P(A_O)=&1/10&\text{ for ordinary people} \\
P(A_B)=&1/100&\text{ for billionaires} \\
\end{cases} 
\\
\\
&P(J)=\text{chance of going to jail}
\begin{cases}
P(J\mid\overline{T})=&1/10&\text{ if you didn't pay taxes that year} \\
P(J\mid T)=&1/100&\text{ if you paid taxes that year} \\
\end{cases} 
\end{align}
$$

the question then becomes focused on the probability of Blimp going to jail, in other words $P(J)$.
