an identity element, or neutral element, of a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] is an element that leaves unchanged every element when the operation is applied.

for example, 0 is an identity element of the addition of real numbers, and 1 is an identity element of multiplication.

## Definitions

let $(S,*)$ be a [[Sets|set]] $S$ with an [[* (operation)|arbitrary binary operation]] $*$, then an element $e$ of $S$ is called a left identity if $e*s=s\space\forall s\in S$, and a right identity if $s*e=s\space\forall s\in S$.

if $e$ is both a left identity and a right identity, then it is called a two-sided identity, or simply an identity.

an identity with respect to addition is called an [[Associativities of Addition and Multiplication|additive identity]] (often 0) and an identity with respect to multiplication is called a multiplicative identity (often 1).

these not need to be always addition or multiplication as the underlying operation is arbitrary such as in the case of a [[Group|group]] where the identity element is simply denoted by $e$.

the multiplicative identity is often called the unity in the context of [[Rings|rings]].
