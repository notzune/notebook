in [[Elementary algebra|elementary algebra]], the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) is the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial.

according to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial $(x+y)^n$ into a sum involving terms of the form $ax^by^c$ where the exponents $b$ and $c$ are [[Natural numbers|nonnegative integers]] with $b+c=n$, and the [[Coefficient|coefficient]] $a$ of each term is a positive [[Integer|integer]] depending on $n$ and $b$.

so if $n=4$ then the expansion would be

$$
(x+y)^4=x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4
$$
