in mathematics, the floor function (or greatest integer function) is the [[Function|function]] that takes as input a [[Real numbers|real number]] $x$, and gives as output the greatest [[Integer|integer]] less than or equal to $x$ denoted $⌊x⌋$ or $\text{floor}(x)$. 

similarly, the ceiling function maps $x$ to the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$, denoted $⌈x⌉$ or $\text{ceil}(x)$.

for example, for floor: $⌊2.4⌋=2$, $⌊-2.4⌋=-3$, and for ceiling: $⌈2.4⌉=3$, and $⌈-2.4⌉=-2$.
