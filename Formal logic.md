formal logic is also known as symbolic logic and is widely used in [[Mathematical logic|mathematical logic]]. it replaces concrete expressions with [[Logical notation|abstract symbols]] to examine the [[Logical form|logical form]] of arguments independent of their concrete content. 

formal logic is interested in [[Deductive reasoning|deductively]] [[Validity|valid]] arguments, for which the truth of their [[Premise|premises]] ensures the truth of their conclusion.

this means it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. for valid arguments, the logical structure of the premises and their conclusion follows a pattern called a [[Rule of inferences|rule of inference]].
