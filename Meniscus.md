in [[Physics|physics]], particularly [[Fluid statics|fluid statics]], the meniscus (pl. menisci) is the curve in the upper surface of a [[Liquid|liquid]] close to the surface of the container or another object, produced by [[Surface tension|surface tension]].

a concave meniscus occurs when the attraction between the particles of the liquid and the container ([[Adhesion|adhesion]]) is more than half the attraction of the particles of the liquid to each other ([[Cohesion|cohesion]]), causing the liquid to "climb" the walls of the container.

this occurs between water and glass and other water-based fluids or other [[Wetting|wettable]] containers.
