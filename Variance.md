in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], variance is the [[Expected value|expected value]] of the [[Squared deviations from the mean (SDM)|squared deviations from the mean]] of a [[Random variables|random variable.]] the [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] is obtained as the square root of the variance. 

variance is a measure of [[Dispersion|dispersion]], meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. it is the second [[Central moment|central moment]] of a distribution, and the [[Covariance|covariance]] of the random variable with itself.

it is often denoted by $\sigma^2$, $s^2$, $\text{Var}(X), V(X)$, or $\mathbb{V}(X)$.

## Definition

the variance of a random variable $X$ is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of $X$, $\mu=\text{E}[X]$:

$$
\text{Var}(X)=\text{E}[(X-\mu)^2]
$$

the variance can also be thought of as the covariance of a random variable with itself:

$$
\text{Var}(X)=\text{Cov}(X,X)
$$
