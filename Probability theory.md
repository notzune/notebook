probability theory, or probability calculus, is the branch of math concerned with [[Probability|probability]]. the [[Axiom|axioms]] of probability theory formalize probability in terms of a [[Probability space|probability space]], which assigns a [[Measure|measure]] taking values between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive), termed the [[Probability measure|probability measure]], to a [[Sets|set]] of [[Outcome|outcomes]] called the [[Sample space|sample space]]. any specified [[Subset|subset]] of the sample space is called an [[Events|event]].
