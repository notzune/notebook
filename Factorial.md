in mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative [[Integer|integer]] $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.

the factorial of $n$ also equals the product of $n$ with the next smaller factorial:

$$
\begin{align}
n!&=n\times(n-1)\times(n-2)\times(n-3)\times\dots\times3\times2\times1 \\

&=n\times(n-1)!
\end{align}
$$

for example,

$$
5!=5\times4!=5\times4\times3\times2\times1=120
$$

the value of $0!$ is $1$, according to the convention for an [[Empty product|empty product]].
