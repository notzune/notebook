in mathematics, a family, or indexed family, is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some [[Index set|index set]]. 

for example, a family of [[Real numbers|real numbers]], indexed by the set of [[Integer|integers]], is a collection of real numbers, where a given [[Function|function]] selects one real number for each integer (possibly the same) as indexing.

formally, an indexed family is a mathematical function together with its [[Domain|domain]] $I$ and [[Image|image]] $X$ (indexed families and mathematical [[Function|functions]] are technically identical, just point of views are different). often the elements of the set $X$ are referred to as making up the family. 

in this context, indexed families are interpreted as collections of indexed elements instead of functions. the set $I$ is called the index set of the family, and $X$ is the indexed set.
