binary code represents text, [[Machine code|computer processor instructions]], or any other data using a two-symbol system. 

the two-symbol system used is often "0" and "1" from the [[Binary|binary number system]]. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as [[Bit|bits]], to each character, instruction, etc. 

for example, a binary string of eight bits (which is also called a [[Byte|byte]]) can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.
