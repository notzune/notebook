a parabola is a [[Plane curve|plane curve]] which is [[Reflection symmetry|mirror-symmetrical]] and is approximately U-shaped; it is a [[Conic sections|conic section]].

a parabola has a [[Point|point]] (the [[Focus|focus]]) and a [[Line|line]] (the [[Directrix|directrix]]). the focus does not lie on the directrix. 

the parabola is the [[Locus of points|locus of points]] in that plane that are [[Equidistant|equidistant]] from the directrix and the focus.

a parabola is given by the function

$$
y=ax^{2}+bx+c,\space\text{where }a\neq0
$$

# Roots

the [[Zero|roots or zeroes]] of a parabola are the values of $x$ for which $y=0$. using the [[Quadratic formula|quadratic formula]], the roots can be found by:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

if the parabola is defined by two roots, $x_1$ and $x_2$, the quadratic can be expressed as

$$
y=a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)
$$

# [[Vertex (geometry)|Vertex]]

the vertex of a parabola is the highest or lowest point, depending on whether the parabola opens upwards ($a>0$) or downwards ($a<0$), the vertex can be found using the formula

$$
x_v=\frac{-b}{2a}
$$

and by substituting $x_v$ back into the original equation, we can find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex ($y_v$),

$$
y_v=a(x_v)^{2}+bx_v+c
$$

## Vertex form

the vertex form of a parabola, which is given by

$$
y=a(x-h)^{2}+k
$$

where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.

# Axis of symmetry

the axis of symmetry is a vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola, and it can be defined by the same equation used to find the $x_v$ of the vertex

$$
x_{\text{symmetry}}=\frac{-b}{2a}
$$

# Focus and directrix

## Focus

the focus of a parabola is a point $(f_x,f_y)$ from which distances are measured to form the parabola. 

the directrix is a line opposite the opening of the parabola. the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the [[Perpendicularity|perpendicular]] distance from that point to the directrix.

the focus for a parabola in vertex form is given by

$$
(f_x,f_y)=\left(h,k+\frac{1}{4a}\right)
$$

## Directrix

the directrix for a parabola in vertex form is the line given by 

$$
y=k-\frac{1}{4a}
$$

# Examples

## Finding a parabola from an ordered pair

say a certain manufacturing plant makes metal cylinders with a diameter of $50.0\,\text{mm}$ with a tolerance[^1] of $0.5\,\text{mm}$. 



[^1]: the [[Tolerance|tolerance of something]] just means plus/minus ($\pm n$) whatever value the tolerance is said to be ($n$), in this case: $50.0\pm0.5=(49.5,50.5)$.
