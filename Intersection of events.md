in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] the [[Events|event]] $A\cap B$ is the [[Intersection|intersection]] of the events $A$ and $B$ and consists of the outcomes that are contained within both events $A$ and $B$. 

the [[Probability value|probability]] of this event ($P(A\cap B)$), is the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously.
