in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] the [[Events|event]] $A\cap B$ is the [[Intersection|intersection]] of the events $A$ and $B$ and consists of the outcomes that are contained within both events $A$ and $B$. 

the [[Probability|probability]] of this event ($P(A\cap B)$), is the probability that both events $A$ and $B$ occur simultaneously. 

if events $A$ and $B$ are [[Disjoint event|mutually exclusive]], they have no outcomes in common so in this case, $A\cap B=\emptyset$, and $P(A\cap B)=0$. 

(see also [[Probabilities of event intersections|probabilities of event intersections]])

### Examples

in the case where an event $A$ is contained within an event $B$ ($A\subset B$), each outcome in $A$ is also in $B$, therefore:

$$
A\cap B=A\text{ where }A\subset B
$$

some other rules concerning the intersection of events:

$$
\begin{align}
&A\cap B=B\cap A \\
&A\cap A=A \\
&A\cap S=A \\
&A\cap\emptyset=\emptyset \\
&A\cap A'=\emptyset \\
&A\cap(B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C \\
\end{align}
$$
