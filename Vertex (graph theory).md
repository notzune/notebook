in [[Discrete mathematics|discrete mathematics]], and more specifically in [[Graph theory|graph theory]], a vertex (pl. vertices) is (together with [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]]) one of the two basic units out of which [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] are constructed.

vertices of graphs are often considered to be atomic objects, with no internal structure.
