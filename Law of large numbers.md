the weak law of large numbers is a central theorem in the study of [[Probability theory|probability theory]]. it states that the [[Arithmetic mean|average]] of the results obtained from a large number of [[Independence|independent]] and identical random samples [[Convergence and divergence|converges]] to a true value if it exists.

let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be a [[Sequence|sequence]] of independent and identically [[Probability distribution|distributed]] random variables, each having a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]] $\mu$  and [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] $\sigma$,

$$
X=\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}
$$

then as $n\rightarrow\infty$, the sample mean equals the population mean $\mu$ of each variable
