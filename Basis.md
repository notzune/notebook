a set $B$ of vectors in a [[Vector Space|vector space]] $V$ is called a basis (pl. bases) if every element of $V$ may be written in a unique way as a finite linear combination of elements of $B$. the [[Coefficient|coefficients]] of this linear combination are referred to as [[Components|components]] or [[Coordinates|coordinates]] of the vector with respect to $B$. the elements of a basis are called [[Basis Vectors|basis vectors]].
