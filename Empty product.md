in math, an empty product or [[Nullary|nullary]] product, is the result of multiplying no factors.

it is by convention equal to the [[Identity element|multiplicative identity]] (assuming there is an identity for the multiplication [[Operation|operation]] in question) just as the [[Empty sum|empty sum]]–the result of adding no numbers–is by convention zero, or the additive identity.

let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots$ be a sequence of numbers and let

$$
P_m=\prod^m_{i=1}a_i=a_1\dots a_m
$$

be the product of the first $m$ elements of the sequence, then

$$
P_m=P_{m-1}a_m
$$

for all $m=1,2,\dots$ provided that we use the convention $P_0=1$.

in other words, a "product" with no factors at all evaluates to 1.
