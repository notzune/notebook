in [[Geometry|geometry]], an angle is the figure formed by two [[Ray|rays]], called the [[Edge (geometry)|sides]] of the angle, sharing a common endpoint called the [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of the angle.

an angle equal to $0\degree$ or not turned is called a zero angle.

an angle smaller than a right angle (smaller than $90\degree$) is called an acute angle.

an angle equal to $90\degree (\frac{\pi}{2})$ or $\frac{1}{4}$ turn is a right angle. the two [[Line|lines]] that form a right angle can be said to be normal, [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] or [[Perpendicularity|perpendicular]].

an angle larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between $90\degree$ and $180\degree$) is called an obtuse angle.

an angle equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ turn ($180\degree$ or $\pi$ radians) is called a straight angle.

an angle larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between $180\degree$ and $360\degree$) is called a reflex angle.

an angle equal to 1 turn ($360\degree$ or $2\pi$) is called a full angle, complete angle, round angle, or perigon.

an angle that is not a multiple of a right angle is called an oblique angle.
