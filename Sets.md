a group of elements (could be anything).

if $S$ is a set then the notation $x∈S$ means that $x$ is an element of $S$. 

the notation $x \notin S$ means that $x$ is not an element of $S$.

sets can be written/specified using the "set roster notation" by writing all of its elements between braces. Such as:
$$ \{1,2,3,...,n\} $$
this is also known as "[[Enumeration|enumeration]]".

the other way a set can be written is using "set builder notation" which takes the form of:

$$ \{ x \in U \mid \text{some condition for } x\}$$
here $U$ is used to denote the "[[Universal set|universal set]]" or the "set in discussion"

for example if we say:
$$\{x \mid x \in N ∧ x\equiv 0\pmod2\}$$
then we are really talking about the set:
$$\{2,4,6,8,...,etc\}$$
in the above example:

- $\{x \mid ...\}$: this is the set builder notation, where $x$ is the variable representing elements of the set.
- $x\in N$: this means that $x$ is an element of the set $N$ (non-neg integers).
- $∧$: this is the logical "and" or [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]. (see: [[Logical notation|logical notation]])
- $x \equiv 0\pmod 2$:  is a formal way of stating that $x$ is even. it means $x$ leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. (this uses [[Modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic]])

according to the [[Axiom of extension|axiom of extension]], a set is completely determined by what its elements are-not the order in which they might be listed or the fact that some elements might be listed more than once.
