not to be confused with [[SDRAM]], static random-access memory (static RAM or SRAM) is a type of [[RAM|random-access memory]] (RAM) that uses latching circuitry ([[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]) to store each bit. 

SRAM is [[Volatile memory|volatile memory]]; data is lost when power is removed.

the term static differentiates SRAM from [[DRAM]] (dynamic random-access memory)

- SRAM will hold its data permanently in the presence of power, while data in DRAM decays in seconds and thus must be periodically refreshed
- SRAM is faster than DRAM but it is more expensive in terms of silicon area and cost
- SRAM is typically used for the [[CPU cache]] and internal [[Processor register|registers]] of a [[CPU|CPU]] while DRAM is used for a computer's [[Computer data storage|main memory]].
