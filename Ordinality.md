for [[Ordinal number|ordinal numbers]], you have a relation between the numbers allowing you to put them in line:

lets say you have some set $S$ with a [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of 3: you can then list it as:

$$\{a,b,c\},\{c,b,a\},\{b,c,a\}, ..., etc$$

but only one of those [[Sets|sets]] (or [[Subset|subsets]]) are ordinal $\{a,b,c\}$ since it goes in order.
