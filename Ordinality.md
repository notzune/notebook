for ordinal numbers, you have a relation between the numbers allowing you to put them in line:

lets say I have some set $S$ with a [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of 3: you can then list it as:

$$\{a,b,c\},\{c,b,a\},\{b,c,a\}, ..., etc$$

but only one of those sets (or subsets) are ordinal $\{a,b,c\}$ since it goes in order.
