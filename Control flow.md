in [[Computer science|computer science]], control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. 

the emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an [[Imperative programming|imperative]] programming language from a [[Declarative programming|declarative]] programming language.

a control flow statement is a [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow.

a set of statements is in turn generally structured as a [[Block (computer programming)|block]], which in addition grouping, also defines a [[Scope (computer programming)|scope]].

control flows are categorized in the following:

- continuation at a different statement (unconditional branch or jump)
- executing a set of statements only if some condition is met (choice –i.e., conditional branch)
- executing a set of statements zero or more times, until some condition is met (i.e., [[Loop (computer science)|loop]] –the same as conditional branch)
- executing a set of distant statements, after which the flow of control usually returns (subroutines, coroutines, and continuations)
- stopping the program, preventing any further executing (unconditional halt)
