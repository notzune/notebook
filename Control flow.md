in [[Computer science|computer science]], control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. 

the emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an [[Imperative programming|imperative]] programming language from a [[Declarative programming|declarative]] programming language.

a control flow statement is a [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow.

a set of statements is in turn generally structured as a [[Block (computer programming)|block]], which in addition grouping, also defines a [[Scope (computer programming)|scope]].
