we can characterize the shape of data by looking at its histogram; if the data values seem to pile up in a single "mound" then the data is [[Unimodality|unimodal]], if two "mounds" then it would be referred to as [[Multimodal distribution|bimodal]].

after determining if it is unimodal or bimodal we determine if the distribution is symmetric, or if it has a "tail" on one side or another. if there is a "tail" then the distribution is skewed in the direction of the longer tail.

if the distribution is symmetric, we will need to check if it's roughly bell-shaped or if all of the "rectangles" of data are roughly the same size then we can say it has a uniform distribution.
