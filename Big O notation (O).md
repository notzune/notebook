big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the [[Limit|limiting]] behavior of a [[Function|function]] when the [[Argument of a function|argument]] tends towards a particular value or infinity. 

big O is a member of the [[Family of notations|family of notations]] collectively called asymptotic notation.

in [[Computer science|computer science]], big O notation is used to [[Computational complexity theory|classify]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]] according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

a description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the growth rate of the [[Function (computer programming)|function]].
