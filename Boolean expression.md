[[Boolean|boolean]] expressions are defined by the [[Boolean operator|boolean operator]] and [[Return type|return]] the [[Value (computer science)|value]] of a [[Boolean (data type)|true or false]]. boolean expressions are ways to implement [[Propositional calculus|propositional calculus]] inside your code by using [[Logic|logical]] expressions such as the use of [[Logical connective|logical connectives]], [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]], and [[Logical equivalence|equivalencies]].

boolean expressions are important and will be used constantly when designing your [[Computer program|program]]'s [[Logic (computer programming)|logic]], especially for things such as [[Do-while loop|do-while loops]] and [[While loop|while loops]].
