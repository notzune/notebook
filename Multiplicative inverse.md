in math, a multiplicative inverse or reciprocal for a number $x$, denoted by $\frac{1}{x}$ or $x^{-1}$, is a number which when multiplied by $x$ yields the [[Identity element|multiplicative identity]], $1$. the multiplicative inverse of a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is $\frac{b}{a}$.

for the multiplicative inverse of a [[Real numbers|real number]], divide 1 by the number. for example, the reciprocal of 5 is $\frac{1}{5}$, (or $0.2$), and the reciprocal of 0.25 is 1 divided by 0.25, or 4.

the [[Reciprocal function|reciprocal function]], the function $f(x)$ that maps $x$ to $\frac{1}{x}$, is one of the simplest examples of a function which is its own inverse (an [[Involution|involution]]).

multiplying by a number is the same as dividing by its reciprocal and vice versa. for example, multiplication by $\frac{4}{5}$ (or 0.8) will give the same result as division by $\frac{5}{4}$ (or 1.25).

therefore, multiplication by a number followed by multiplication by its reciprocal yields the original number (since the product of the number and its reciprocal is 1).
