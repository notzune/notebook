in math, a sequence is an [[Enumeration|enumerated]] collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters. 

like a [[Sets|set]], it contains members (also called elements, or terms). the number of elements (which can be infinite) is called the length of the sequence.

unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter.

formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[Function|function]] from [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position.
