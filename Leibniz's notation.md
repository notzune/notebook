in [[Calculus|calculus]], Leibniz's notation, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ to represent infinitely small ([[Infinitesimal|infinitesimal]]) increments of $x$ and $y$, just as $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are used to represent finite increments of $x$ and $y$, respectively.  

consider $y$ as a [[Function|function]] of a variable $x$, or $y=f(x)$, if this is the case, then the [[Derivative|derivative]] of $y$ with respect to $x$ (the [[Limit|limit]])

$$
\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x},
$$

was the quotient of an infinitesimal increment of $y$ by an infinitesimal increment of $x$, or

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=f\prime(x)
$$

where the right hand side is
