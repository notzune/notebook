in [[Logic|logic]], the logical form of a statement is a precisely-specified semantic version of that statement in a formal system.

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{All humans are mortal.} \\
&\text{All Socrates is human.} \\
&\text{Therefore, Socrates is mortal.} \\
\end{align}
$$

or,

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{All $H$ are $M$} \\
&\text{$S$ is $H$} \\
&\text{Therefore, $S$ is $H$} \\
\end{align}
$$
