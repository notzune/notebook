in [[Exponentiation|exponentiation]], the base is the number $b$ in an expression of the form $b^{n}$. 

the number $n$ is called the [[Exponent|exponent]] and the expression is known formally as exponentiation of $b$ by $n$ or the exponential of $n$ with base $b$.

more commonly referred to as "the $n$th power of $b$", "$b$ to the $n$th power", or "$b$ to the power of $n$".

the term "power" strictly refers to the entire expression, but is sometimes used to refer to the exponent.

[[Radix|radix]] is the traditional term for base.
