a star or asterisk "$*$" is used in abstract algebra to denote some arbitrary or general [[Binary operation|binary operation]] such as multiplication or addition. you can think of the asterisk as a placeholder when used in the context of defining an axiom or proof that has to do with binary operations.

for example if we have a set $S$ and a binary operation "$*$", the [[Operation|operation]] might be defined as as:

$$
*:S\times S\rightarrow S
$$

which means for any two elements $a$ and $b$ in $S$, $(a*b)$ is also in $S$:

$$
\forall a,b\in S\implies(a*b)\in S
$$
