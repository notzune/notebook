in [[Discrete mathematics|discrete mathematics]], and more specifically in [[Graph theory|graph theory]], a graph is a structure amounting to a [[Sets|set]] of objects in which pairs of the objects are in some sense "related".

the objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] (also called a link or line).
