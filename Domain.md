the domain of a [[Function|function]] is the [[Sets|set]] of inputs accepted by the function. it is sometimes denoted by $\text{dom}(f)$ or $\text{dom }f$, where $f$ is a function.

given a function $f : X\rightarrow Y$, the domain of $f$ is $X$. 

in the special case that $X$ and $Y$ are both sets of [[Real Numbers|real numbers]], the function $f$ can be graphed in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian coordinate system]]. in this case, the domain is represented on the $x$-axis of the graph, as the projection of the function onto the $x$-axis.

for a function $f : X\rightarrow Y$, the set $Y$ is the [[Codomain|codomain]], and the set of values attained by the function (which is a subset of $Y$) is called its [[Range|range]] or [[Image|image]].

any function can be restricted to a [[Subset|subset]] of its domain. 

the restriction of $f:X\rightarrow Y$ to $A$, where $A\subseteq X$, is written as:

$$
\left.f\right|_A:A\rightarrow Y
$$
