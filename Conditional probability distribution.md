in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], the conditional probability distribution is a [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] that describes the probability of an [[Outcome|outcome]] given the occurance of a particular [[Events|event]].

given two [[Joint probability distribution|jointly distributed]] [[Random variables|random variables]], $X$ and $Y$, the conditional probability distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is the probability distribution of $Y$ when $X$ is known to be a particular value.

when both $X$ and $Y$ are [[Categorical variable|categorical variables]], a [[Conditional probability table|conditional probability table]] is used to represent the probability.
