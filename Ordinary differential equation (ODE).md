in math, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a [[Differential equations|differential equation]] dependent on a single independent variable. as with other differentials, its unknown(s) consist of one (or more) function(s) and involves the [[Derivative|derivatives]] of those functions. the term "ordinary" is used in contrast with [[Partial differential equation (PDE)|partial differential equations]] which may be with respect to *more than* one independent variable. 

a [[Linear differential equation|linear differential equation]] is a differential equation that is defined by a [[Polynomial|linear polynomial]] in the unkown function and its derivatives, that is an equation of the form

$$
a_0(x)y+a_1(x)y\prime+a_2(x)y^n+\dots+a_n(x)y^n+b(x)=0,
$$

where $a_0(x)y,\dots,a_n(x)$ and $b(x)$ are arbitrary [[Differentiable functions|differentiable functions]] that do not need to be linear, and $y\prime,\dots,y^{(n)}$ are the successive derivatives of the unknown function $y$ of the variable $x$.
