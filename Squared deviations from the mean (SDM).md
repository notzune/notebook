squared deviations from the mean (SDM) result from squaring [[Deviation|deviations]]. 

in [[Probability theory|probability theory]] and [[Statistics|statistics]], the definition of [[Variance|variance]] is either the [[Expected value|expected value]] of the SDM (when considering a theoretical [[Probability distribution|distribution]]) or its average value (for actual data).

$$
\begin{align}
\text{E}(X^2),\text{ where E is the expected value operator}
\end{align}
$$

for a [[Random variables|random variable]] $X$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$,

$$
\sigma^2=\text{E}(X^2)-\mu^2
$$

therefore,

$$
\text{E}(X^2)=\sigma^2+\mu^2
$$

from this, we can derive

$$
\begin{align}
\text{E}(\sum(X^2))&=n\sigma^2+n\mu^2 \\
\\
\text{E}((\sum X)^2)&=n\sigma^2+n^2\mu^2
\end{align}
$$
