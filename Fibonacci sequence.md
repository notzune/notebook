the Fibonacci sequence is a [[Sequence|sequence]] in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

numbers that are part of the Fibonacci are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted $F_n$.

the sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.

starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins

$$
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,...
$$

## Definition

the Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the [[Recurrence relation|recurrence relation]]

$$
F_0=0,\space F_1=1
$$

and,

$$
F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},\text{ for }n>1
$$
