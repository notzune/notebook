function composition (also known as compound functions) is an operation ( $\circ$ ) that takes two functions $f$ and $g$ and produces a function $h=g\circ f$ such that $h(x)=g(f(x))$.

in this operation, the function $g$ is applied to the result of the applying of the function $f$ to $x$.

in other words, the functions $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ are composed to result in a function that maps $x$ in the [[Domain|domain]] of $X$ to $g(f(x))$ in the [[Codomain|codomain]] $Z$.

if $z$ is a function of $y$, and $y$ is a function of x, then $z$ is a function of $x$ ([[Transitive Relation|through the transitive property]]).

the resulting composite function is denoted:

$$
g\circ f:X\rightarrow Z
$$

defined by:

$$
(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))\space\forall x\in X
$$
