in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], a probability space or a probability triple ($\Omega,\mathcal{F},P$), is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a [[Randomness|random]] process. 

a probability space consists of three elements:

1. a [[Sample space|sample space]], $\Omega$, which is the [[Sets|set]] of all possible [[Outcome|outcomes]]
2. an event space, which is the set of [[Events|events]], $\mathcal{F}$; an event being a set of outcomes in the sample space
3. a [[Probability measure|probability function]], $P$, which assigns, to each event in the event space, a [[Probability|probability]] which is a number between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive).
