argument–deduction–proof distinctions originated with [[Logic|logic]] itself.

## Argument

an [[Argument|argument]], more fully a premise-conclusion argument is a two-part system composed of [[Premise|premises]] and [[Consequent|conclusion]].

an argument is valid if and only if its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises.

## Deduction

a [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates–steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises.

## Proof

a [[Formal proof|proof]] is a deduction whose premises are known truths. 

a proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for example is a deduction that might use several premises – [[Axioms|axioms, postulates]], and definitions – and contain dozens of intermediate steps.
