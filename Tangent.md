in [[Geometry|geometry]], the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane [[Curve|curve]] at a given point is just the [[Line|line]] that "just touches" the curve at that point. it is also defined as the line through a pair of [[Infinitesimal|infinitely close]] points on the curve.

a straight line is tangent to the curve $y=f(x)$ at a point $x=c$ if the line passes through the point $(c,f(c))$ on the curve and has [[Slope|slope]] $f\prime(c)$, where $f\prime$ is the [[Derivative|derivative]] of $f$.
