a relation $R$ on a set $A$ is symmetric if, whenever an element $a$ is related to another element $b$, $b$ is also related to $a$.

formally, $R$ is symmetric if $\forall a, b\in A, (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R$.

an example in [[Logic|logic]] would be "is a sibling of" because if $a$ is a sibling of $b$ then $b$ must be a sibling of $a$.

this also applies to "=" since $a = b \iff b = a$, this is covered further in [[Equivalence Relation|equivalence relations]].
