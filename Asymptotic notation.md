asymptotic notation is a way to describe the running time or space complexity of an [[Algorithm|algorithm]] based on the input size. it is commonly used in [[Time complexity|complexity analysis]] to describe how an algorithm performs as the size of the input grows.

the three most commonly used notations are:

# [[Big O notation (O)]]

provides an [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space usage. it represents the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.

# [[Big Omega notation (Ω)]]

this notation provides a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space usage. it represents the best-case scenario (the minimum amount of time or space an algorithm may need to solve a problem)

# [[Big Theta notation (Θ)]]

this notation provides both an upper and lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time or space usage. it represents the average-case scenario of the amount of time or space an algorithm typically needs to solve a problem.
