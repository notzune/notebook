essentially the same as the [[Associativities of Addition and Multiplication|associative property of addition and multiplication]], that the grouping of sets does not matter for union or intersection operations:

$$
\begin{align*} 
(A\cap B)\cap C &= A\cap(B\cap C) \\
(A\cup B)\cup C &= A\cup(B\cup C) \\
\end{align*}
$$
