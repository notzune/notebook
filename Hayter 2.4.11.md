a machine produces iron bars whose lengths have a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]] ($\mu$) of $110.8$ cm and a [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] of $0.5$ cm. we want to find the lower bound on the [[Probability|probability]] that an iron bar chosen at random has a length between $109.55$ cm and $112.05$ cm.

we can use [[Chebyshev's inequality]] to calculate the lower bound of the number
