in the seven-layer [[OSI model]] of [[Computer networking|computer networking]], the network layer is layer 3.

the network layer is responsible for [[Packet forwarding|packet forwarding]] including [[Routing|routing]] through intermediate [[Router|routers]].

the network layer provides the means of transferring variable-length [[Network packet|network packets]] from a source to a destination [[Host (network)|host]] via one or more networks. 

within the service layering semantics of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) network architecture, the network layer responds to service requests from the [[Transport layer|transport layer]] and issues service requests to the [[Data link layer|data link layer]].
