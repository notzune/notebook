a power of two is a number of the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an [[Integer|integer]].

that is, the result of [[Exponentiation|exponentiation]] with number two as the [[Base|base]] and integer $n$ as the [[Exponent|exponent]].

in a context where only integers are considered, $n$ is restricted to non-negative values.
