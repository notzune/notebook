in mathematics, the cardinality of a [[Sets|set]] is a measure of the number of [[Element|elements]] of the set.

for example, the set $A=\{2,4,6\}$ contains 3 elements and therefore $A$ has a cardinality of 4. the cardinality of set $A$ is usually denoted $|A|$.

cardinality is different from [[Ordinality|ordinality]].
