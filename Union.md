if given [[Sets|sets]] $A$ and $B$ then the union of $A$ and $B$ ($A\cup B$) results in the set of all [[Element|elements]] which are in $A$, in $B$, or in both $A$ and $B$.

$$
A\cup B=\{x:x\in A\vee x\in B\}
$$

for example, if $A=\{1,3,5,7\}$ and $B=\{1,2,4,6,7\}$, then $A\cup B=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$.

a nullary union refers to a union of zero sets and it is by definition equal to the [[Empty set|empty set]] ($\emptyset$)

a binary union is an [[Associative property|associative]] operation; that is for any sets $A$,$B$, and $C$,

$$
A\cup(B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C
$$

thus the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity. unions are also [[Commutative property|commutative]], so the sets can be written in any order. 

the empty set ($\emptyset$) is an [[Identity element|identity element]] for the operation of union. ($A\cup\emptyset = A$ for any set $A$).

the union operation is also [[Idempotent|idempotent]], $A\cup A=A$

all these properties follow from analogous facts about [[Logical disjunction|logical disjunction]].
