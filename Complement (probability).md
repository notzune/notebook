in [[Probability theory|probability]], the [[Complement|complement]] of an event $A$ is taken to mean the event consisting of everything in the [[Sample space|sample space]] $S$ that is not contained within the event $A$.

the notation $A'$ is used for the complement of $A$.

the probability of the complement of $A$ is obtained by summing the probabilities of the five outcomes not contained within $A$, so that

$$
P(A')=0.10+0.05+0.05+0.15+0.10=0.45
$$

a general rule is that the sum of the probability of the event and its complement is:

$$
P(A)+P(A')=1
$$
