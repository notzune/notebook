in mathematics, especially in [[Order theory|order theory]], a preorder is a [[Binary relation|binary relation]] that is [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[Transitive relation|transitive]]. preorders are more general than [[Equivalence relation|equivalence relations]] and (non-strict) [[Partially ordered set|partial orders]], both of which are special cases of a preorder: an [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] preorder is a partial order, and a [[Symmetric relation|symmetric]] preorder is an equivalence relation.

formally, consider a [[Homogeneous relation|homogenous relation]] $\leq$ on some given set $P$, so that by definition $\leq$ is some subset of $P\times P$ and the notation $a\leq b$ is used in place of $(a,b)\in\,\leq$. then $\leq$ is called a preorder if it is reflexive and transitive; that is, if it satisfies:

1. reflexivity: $a\leq a$ for all $a\in P$
2. transitivity: if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq c$ then $a\leq c$ for all $a,b,c\in P$
