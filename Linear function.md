the term linear function refers to two distinct but related notions:

- in [[Calculus|calculus]] and related areas, a linear function is a [[Function|function]] whose graph is a straight line, that is a [[Polynomial|polynomial function]] of [[Degree|degree]] zero or one. For distinguishing this type of linear function from the other concept, use the term [[Affine transformation|affine function]].
- in [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]], and [[Functional analysis|functional analysis]], a linear function is a [[Linear map|linear map]].
