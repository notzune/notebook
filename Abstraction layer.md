in [[Computing|computing]], an abstraction layer or abstraction level is a way of hiding the working details of a subsystem. 

examples of software models that use layers of abstraction include the [[OSI model (subindex)|OSI model]] for [[Internet protocol suite|network protocols]].

in [[Computer science|computer science]], an abstraction layer is a generalization of a conceptual model or [[Algorithm|algorithm]], away from any specific implementation.

a layer is considered to be on top of another if it [[Coupling (computer programming)|depends]] on it. 

every layer can exist without the layers above it, and requires the layers below it to function.
