non-volatile memory (NVM) or non-volatile storage is a type of [[Computer memory|computer memory]] that can retain stored information even after power is removed. in contrast, [[Volatile memory|volatile memory]] needs constant power in order to retain data.

non-volatile memory typically refers to storage in [[Semiconductor memory|semiconductor memory chips]], which store data in [[Floating-gate MOSFET|floating-gate memory cells]] consisting of [[MOSFET|MOSFETs]], including [[Flash memory|flash memory storage]] such as NAND flash and [[Solid-state drives (SSD)|solid-state drives]] (SSD).

other examples of non-volatile memory are [[ROM]], [[PROM]], [[EPROM]], [[EEPROM]] and most types of [[Computer data storage|computer data storage]] devices (such as [[Hard disk drive (HDD)|hard disk drives]], etc.).
