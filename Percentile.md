in [[Statistics|statistics]], a $k$-th percentile is a score below which a given percentage $k$ of scores in its [[Frequency distribution|frequency distribution]] falls (**exclusive**) or a score *at* or *below* which a given percentage falls (**inclusive**).

in the [[Limit|limit]] of an infinite [[Sample space|sample size]], the percentile approximates the [[Percentile function|percentile function]], which is the [[Inverse functions|inverse]] of the [[Cumulative distribution function (CDF)|cumulative distribution function]].

one definition of percentile is that the $P$-th percentile $(0<P\leq100)$ is a list of $N$ ordered values (from least to greatest) is the smallest value in the list such that no more than $P$ percent of the data is strictly less than the value and at least $P$ percent of the data is list than or equal to that value.

this is obtained by first calculating the [[Ordinality|ordinal]] rank and then taking the value from the ordered list that corresponds to the rank.

the ordinal rank $n$ is calculated using

$$
n=\left\lceil\frac{P}{100}\times N\right\rceil
$$
