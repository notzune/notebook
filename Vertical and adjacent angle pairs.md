when two straight [[Line|lines]] intersect at a [[Point|point]], four [[Angle|angles]] are formed.

the pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an "X" shape are called vertical angles, opposite angles, or vertically opposite angles; abbreviated as $\text{vert. opp.}\,\angle{s}$. 

adjacent angles, abbreviated as $\text{adj.}\,\angle{s}$., are angles that share a common [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and [[Edge (geometry)|edge]] but do not share any interior points. 

in other words, they are angles side by side or adjacent, sharing an "arm". 

adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle, or full angle are special and are called [[Special types of adjacent angles#Complementary|complementary]], [[Special types of adjacent angles#Supplementary|supplementary]], and [[Special types of adjacent angles#Explementary|explementary]] angles; respectively. 

in the figure, angles $A$ and $B$ are a pair of vertical angles; angles $C$ and $D$ are also a pair of vertical angles. $A$ and $D$ are adjacent to each other and so are $B$ and $C$ (and by extension, $D$ and $B$ are adjacent and so are $A$ and $C$).

[[Hatch marks|hatch marks]] are used in the figure to show angle equality.

these two vert. angles are [[Congruence|congruent]]. 

a [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often [[Parallel|parallel]]) lines and is associated with alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, interior angles, and exterior angles.
 
# Proof of congruence

when two adjacent angles form a straight line they are supplementary, therefore if we assume the measure of angle $A$ equals $x$, then the measure of angle $C$ would be $180\degree-x$.

following this, the angle of $D$ would also be $180\degree-x$ and therefore $D=C$ which means they would be congruent. 

we can then use any of the two angles of $D$ or $C$ to determine the measure of angle $B$ since it is supplementary to both $C$ and $D$, therefore to find the measure

$$
180\degree-(180\degree-x)=180\degree-180\degree+x=x
$$

therefore, angle $B$ has the same measure of angle $A$ and we just proved they are congruent.
