is a valid [[Logical form|argument form]], a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[Syllogism|syllogism]] with a conditional statement for one or both of its [[Premise|premises]].

hypothetical syllogisms come in two types: mixed and pure.

a mixed hypothetical syllogism has two premises: one [[Conditional statement|conditional statement]] and one statement that either affirms or denies the [[Antecedent|antecedent]] or [[Consequent|consequent]] of that conditional statement.

for example, 

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{if P, then Q.} \\
&\text{P.} \\
&\therefore Q. \\
\end{align}
$$

in this example, the first premise is a conditional statement in which "P" is the antecedent and "Q" is the consequent. the second premise "affirms" the antecedent, the conclusion, that the consequent must be true, is [[Deductive reasoning|deductively]] [[Validity|valid]].

a mixed hypothetical syllogism has four possible forms, two of which are valid, while the other two are invalid.

a valid mixed hypothetical syllogism either affirms the antecedent ([[Modus ponens|modus ponens]]) or denies the consequent ([[Modus tollens|modus tollens]]).

an invalid hypothetical syllogism either [[Affirming the consequent|affirms the consequent]] (fallacy of the [[Converse (Logic)|converse]]) or [[Denying the antecedent|denies the antecedent]] (fallacy of the [[Inverse (Logic)|inverse]])

a pure hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism in which both premises and the conclusion are all [[Conditional statement|conditional statements]]. the antecedent of one premise must match the consequent of the other for the conditional to be valid.

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{if P, then Q.} \\
&\text{if Q, then R.} \\
&\therefore\text{if P, then R.} \\
\end{align}
$$

an example in english:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{if I do not wake up, then I cannot go to work.} \\
&\text{if I cannot go to work, then I will not get paid.} \\
&\text{Therefore, if I do not wake up, then I will not get paid.} \\
\end{align}
$$
