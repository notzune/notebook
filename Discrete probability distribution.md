a discrete probability distribution is the [[Probability distribution|probability distribution]] of a [[Random variables|random variable]] that can take on only a countable number of values which means that the [[Probability|probability]] of any [[Events|event]] $E$ can be expressed as a (finite or countably infinite) sum:

$$
P(X\in E)=\sum_{\omega\in A\cap E}P(X=\omega)
$$

where $A$ is a countable [[Sets|set]] with $P(X\in A)=1$.
