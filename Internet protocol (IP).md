the internet protocol (IP) is the [[Network layer|network layer]] [[Communication protocol|communications protocol]] in the [[Internet protocol suite|internet protocol suite]] for relaying [[Datagram|datagrams]] across network boundaries. 

its [[Routing|routing]] function enables [[Internetworking|internetworking]], and essentially establishes the [[Internet|internet]].

IP has the task of delivering [[Network packet|packets]] from the source [[Host (network)|host]] to the destination host solely based on the [[IP address|IP addresses]] in the packet [[Header (computing)|headers]].

for this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]] the data to be delivered.

it also defines addressing methods that are used to label the [[Datagram|datagram]] with source and destination information.
