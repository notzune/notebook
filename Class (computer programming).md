in [[Object-Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]], a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating [[Object (computer science)|objects]], providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)

when an object is created by a [[Constructor (computer programming)|constructor]] of the class, the resulting object is called an [[Instance (computer programming)|instance]] of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called instance variables, in contrast with the class variables shared across the class.

the class that contains the `main` [[Function (computer programming)|method]] is referred to as the main class and is the entry/starting point of a program.
