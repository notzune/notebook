in [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]], inheritance is the mechanism of basing an [[Object (computer science)|object]] or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. 

it is also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
