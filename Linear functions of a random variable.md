a [[Linear|linear]] [[Function|function]] of a [[Random variables|random variable]] $X$ is another random variable

$$
Y=aX+b
$$

for some numbers $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, it is a general result that 

$$
E(Y)=aE(X)+b
$$

so that the [[Expected value|expectation]] of the random variable $Y$ is just the same linear function of the expectation of the random variable $X$, however for the variance,

$$
\text{Var}(Y)=a^{2}\text{Var}(X)
$$

and the [[Standard deviation|standard deviation]] of $Y$, $\sigma_{Y}$, is given by

$$
\sigma_{Y}=|a|\sigma_{X}
$$

where $\sigma_X$ is the standard deviation of $X$. note that the "shift" amount ($b$) does not influence the variance of $Y$ and that the "scale" amount ($a$) is *squared* in the relationship between the two variances.
