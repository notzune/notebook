for a sequence $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ of [[Disjoint event|mutually exclusive events]] the probability of the [[Union of events|union]] of the [[Events|events]] is given by 

$$
P(A_1\cup\dots\cup A_n)=P(A_1)+\dots+P(A_n)
$$

if the sequence of mutually exclusive events has the added property that their union consists of the whole [[Sample space|sample space]] $S$, then they are said to be an exhaustive sequence.

that sequence also provides a partition of the sample space.

a [[Partition|partition]] of a sample space is a sequence $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$ of mutually exclusive events for which 

$$
A_1\cup\dots\cup A_n=S
$$

each outcome in the sample space is then contained within one and only one of the events $A_i$.
