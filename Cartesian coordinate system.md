a cartesian coordinate system in a [[Euclidean Plane|plane]] is a [[Coordinate system|coordinate system]] that specifies each point uniquely by a pair of [[Real Numbers|real numbers]] called [[Coordinates|coordinates]], which are the [[Signed|signed]] distances to the point from two fixed [[Perpendicularity|perpendicular]] oriented lines, called [[Coordinate Lines|coordinate lines]], coordinate axes, or just axes (plural of axis) of the system. 

the point where they meet is called [[Origin|origin]] and its coordinates are $(0,0)$.

the position of any point in three-dimensional space can be specified by three Cartesian coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to three mutually perpendicular planes. More generally, $n$ Cartesian coordinates specify the point in an $n$-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] for any [[Dimension|dimension]] $n$. 

these coordinates are the signed distances from the point to $n$ mutually perpendicular fixed [[Hyperplanes|hyperplanes]].
