a statement in which if something is true then something else must be true (if-then statements).

more formally, it is a sentence that expresses that one thing is contingent on something else, i.e. "if it rains, the picnic will be cancelled." 

they are called conditional statements because the impact of the main clause of the sentence is *conditional* on the dependent clause.

a full conditional sentence thus contains two clauses: a dependent clause called the [[Antecedent|antecedent]] (or prostais or if-clause), which expresses the condition, and a main clause called the [[Consequent|consequent]] (or apodosis or then-clause) expressing the result.
