computer memory stores information, such as data and programs for immediate use in the [[Computer|computer]].

the term memory is often synonymous with the term primary storage, or main storage.

an archaic synonym for memory is **store**.

main memory operates at a high speed compared to [[Computer data storage|storage]] which is slower but less expensive and higher in capacity.

besides storing opened programs, computer memory serves as [[Page cache|disk cache]] and [[Write buffer|write buffer]] to improve both reading and writing performance. 

operating systems borrow [[RAM]] capacity for caching so long as not needed by running software. if needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to storage; a common way of doing this is through a memory management technique called [[Virtual memory|virtual memory]].

modern computer memory is implemented as [[Semiconductor memory|semiconductor memory]], where data is stored within [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] built from [[MOSFET|MOS transistors]] and other components on an [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuit]].

there are two main kinds of semiconductor memory: [[Volatile memory|volatile]] and [[Non-volatile memory (NVM)|non-volatile]].

most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells each storing one [[Bit|bit]] (0 or 1). 

[[Flash memory|flash memory]] organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multi-level cell capable of storing multiple bits per cell. the memory cells are grouped into [[Word (computer architecture)|words of fixed word length]], for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 bits.

each word can be accessed by a binary [[Memory address|address]] of $N$ bits, making it possible to store $2^N$ words in the memory.
