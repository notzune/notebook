in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], the likelihoods of a particular outcome actually occurring are found by assigning a [[Sets|set]] of probability values to each of the elements of the [[Sample space|sample space]].

a set of probability values for an experiment with a sample space $S=\{O_1,O_2,\dots,O_n\}$ consists of some probabilities

$$
p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n
$$

that satisfy

$$
0\leq p_1\leq1,0\leq p_2\leq1,\dots,0\leq p_n\leq1
$$

for a coin toss the probabilities will in general be given by 

$$
P(\text{head})=p,\space\text{ and }P(\text{tail})=1-p
$$

for some value of $p$ with $0\leq p\leq1$. a fair coin will have $p=0.5$ so that

$$
P(\text{head})=P(\text{tail})=0.5
$$

with two outcomes being equally likely. a biased coin will have $p\neq0.5$. for example if $p=0.6$, then

$$
P(\text{head})=0.6,\space P(\text{tail})=0.4
$$
