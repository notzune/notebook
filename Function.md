a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ assigns to each element of $X$ exactly one element of $Y$.
the set of $X$ is called the [[Domain|domain]] of the function and the set $Y$ is called the [[Codomain|codomain]].
formally it can be denoted by:

$$
x\mapsto f(x)
$$

meaning $x$ maps to $f(x)$, or more commonly:

$$
f:X\rightarrow Y
$$

a function is uniquely represented by the [[Sets|set]] of all pairs $(x,f(x))$ called the graph of the function. when the domain and the codomain are sets of [[Real numbers|real numbers]], each such pair may be thought of as the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of a point in the plane.

a function has one or more arguments in the form of [[Independence|independent variables]] designated in the definition, which can also contain [[Parameter|parameters]]. The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments that the function takes, where as the parameters are not. 

for example, in the [[Logarithmic functions|logarithmic function]] $f(x) = \log_{b}(x)$, the [[Base|base]] $b$ is considered a [[Parameter|parameter]].
