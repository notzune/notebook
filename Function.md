a function has one or more arguments in the form of [[Independent Variable|independent variables]] designated in the definition, which can also contain [[Parameters|parameters]]. The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments that the function takes, where as the parameters are not. 

for example, in the [[Logarithmic functions|logarithmic function]] $f(x) = \log_{b}(x)$, the [[Base|base]] $b$ is considered a [[Parameters|parameter]].
