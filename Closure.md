a [[Subset|subset]] of a given [[Sets|set]] is closed under an [[Operation|operation]] pf the larger set if performing that operation on members of the subset always produces a member of that subset.

for example, the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]] are closed under addition, but not under subtraction:

$1-2$ is not a natural number, although both $1\text{ and }2$ are.

# Definition

let $S$ be a set with one or several methods for producing elements of $S$ from other elements of $S$.

a subset $X$ of $S$ is said to be closed under these methods if when all inputs are in $X$ then all possible results are also in $X$. this is also referred to as the closure property.

the main property of closed sets, which results from the definition, is that every [[Intersection|intersection]] of closed sets is a closed set. 

for every subset $Y$ of $S$ there is a smallest closed subset $X$ of $S$ such that $Y\subseteq X$.
