in [[Set theory|set theory]], several ways have been proposed to construct the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]]. 

in Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, the natural numbers are defined [[Recursion|recursively]] by letting $0=\{\}$ be the [[Empty set|empty set]] and $n+1$ (the successor function) $=n\cup\{n\}$ for each $n$. 

this way, $n=\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}$ for each natural number $n$. the definition has the property that $n$ is a [[Sets|set]] with $n$ [[Element|elements]]. 

the first few numbers defined this way are:

$$
\begin{align}
&0=\{\} &= &\emptyset \\
&1=\{0\} &= &\{\emptyset\}, \\
&2=\{0,1\} &= &\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}, \\
&3=\{0,1,2\} &=&\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}, \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\}, \\
\end{align}
$$
