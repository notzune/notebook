a binary relation associates [[Element|elements]] of one [[Sets|set]], called the [[Domain|domain]], with elements of another set, called the [[Codomain|codomain]].

a binary relation over sets $X$ and $Y$ is a new set of [[Ordered pair|ordered pairs]] $(x,y)$, consisting of elements $x$ from $X$ and $y$ from $Y$.

(see also: [[Cartesian product|cartesian product]])

a binary relation is a generalization of a [[Unary relation|unary relation]]. it encapsulates the common concept of a relation: an element $x$ is related to an element $y$, if and only if the pair $(x,y)$ belongs to the set of ordered pairs that defines the binary relation.

an example is the "divides" relation over the set of all prime numbers ($\mathbb{P}$) and the set of all integers ($\mathbb{Z}$), in which each prime, $p$, is related to each integer, $z$ that is a multiple of $p$, but not to an integer that is not a multiple of $p$.

other examples of binary relations:
- the "is greater than", "is equal to", and "divides" relations in [[Arithmetic|arithmetic]]
- the "is [[Congruence|congruent]] to" relation in [[Geometry|geometry]]
- the "is adjacent to" relation in [[Graph theory|graph theory]]
- the "[[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to" relation in [[Linear algebra|linear algebra]]
