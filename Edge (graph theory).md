an edge is (together with [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]) one of the two basic units out of which graphs are constructed. 

each edge has two (or in hypergraphs, more) vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints. 

edges may be directed or undirected; undirected edges are also called lines and directed edges are also called arcs or arrows. 

in an undirected [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], an edge may be represented as the [[Sets|set]] of its vertices, and in a directed simple graph it may be represented as an [[Ordered pair|ordered pair]] of its vertices. 

an edge that connects vertices $x$ and $y$ is sometimes written $xy$.
