volatile memory, in contrast to [[Non-volatile memory (NVM)|non-volatile memory]], is [[Computer memory|computer memory]] that requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is quickly lost.

volatile memory has several uses including as [[Computer data storage|primary storage]]. 

in addition to usually being faster than forms of [[Mass storage|mass storage]] such as a [[Hard disk drive (HDD)|hard disk drive]], volatility can protect sensitive information, as it becomes unavailable on power-down. 

most general-purpose random-access memory ([[RAM]]) is volatile

examples of volatile memory are dynamic random-access memory ([[DRAM]]) used for primary storage, and static random-access memory ([[SRAM]]) used mainly for [[CPU cache]].
