in logic, the comprehension of an object is the totality of [[Intension|intensions]], that is attributes, characters, marks, properties, or qualities, that the object posesses, or else the totality of intensions that are pertinent to the context of a given discussion.

this is the correct technical term for the whole collection of intensions of an object, but it is common in less technical usage to see "intension" used for both the composite and the primitive ideas.
