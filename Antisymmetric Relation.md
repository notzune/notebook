a relation $R$ on a set $A$ is symmetric if, whenever an element $a$ and an element $b$ are distinct and $a$ is related to $b$, then $b$ is not related to $a$.

formally, $R$ is antisymmetric if $\forall a, b \in A, (a,b) \in R \wedge (b,a) \in R \implies a = b$

for example $\leq$ (less than or equal to) is also antisymmetric because if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq a$, then $a = b$
