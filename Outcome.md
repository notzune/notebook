in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], an outcome is a possible result of an experiment or trial. each possible outcome of a particular experiment is unique, and different outcomes are [[Disjoint event|mutually exclusive]] (only one outcome will occur on each trial of the experiment).

all the possible outcomes of an experiment form the elements of a [[Sample space|sample space]].

since individual outcomes may be of little practical importance or because there might be an infinite number of them, outcomes are grouped into [[Sets|sets]] of outcomes that satisfy the same condition. these are called "[[Events|events]]".

outcomes have probabilities that are between zero and one (inclusive)
