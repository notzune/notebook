a multiple-conclusion logic is one in which [[Logical consequence|logical consequence]] is a [[Relation|relation]], $\vdash$, between two [[Sets|sets]] of sentences (or [[Proposition|propositions]]). 

$$
\Gamma\vdash\Delta
$$
is typically interpreted as meaning that whenever each element of $\Gamma$ is true, some element of $\Delta$ is true; and whenever each element of $\Delta$ is false, some element of $\Gamma$ is false.
