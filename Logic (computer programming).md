in [[Computer programming|computer programming]], logic is a term used to refer to the [[Logic|logical]] code that *implements* some [[Function (computer programming)|function]] or [[Function (computer programming)#Definition of a Method ( Object-Oriented Programming OOP )|method]].

in other words, it is used to refer to the actual code that does something.

for example, let's use this code [[Code snippet|snippet]] from this [[Java]] [[Example Java Class (reference)|reference]] [[Class (computer programming)|class]]:

```java
// ... rest of code

	public double sumOfCubes(double val1, double val2) {
		// here we seee the method body (logic)
		double cubeVal1 = Math.pow(val1, 3.0);
		double cubeVal2 = Math.pow(val2, 3.0);

		double sum = cubeVal1 + cubeVal2;
		return sum;
	}

// ... rest of code
```

as you can see, it's synonymous with the definition of the [[Method body (object-oriented programming)|method body]].
