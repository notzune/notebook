in math, the distributive property of [[Binary operation|binary operations]] is a generalization of the distributive law which asserts that the equality

$$
x\cdot(y+z)=x\cdot y+x\cdot z
$$

is always true in [[Elementary algebra|elementary algebra]]. for example, a basic arithmetic problem could be

$$
2\cdot(1+3)=(2\cdot1)+(2\cdot3)
$$

therefore we could say that [[Distributivity of multiplication over addition|multiplication distributes over addition]].

# Definition

given a [[Sets|set]] $S$ and two binary operators $*$ and $+$ on $S$, the operation $*$ is distributive over (or with respect to) + if, given any elements $x$, $y$ and $z$ of $S$,

$$
x*(y+z)=(x*y)+(x*z)
$$

the operation $*$ is right-distributive over $+$ if, given any elements $x$, $y$ and $z$ of $S$,

$$
(y+z)*x=(y*z)+(z*x)
$$

and the operation is $*$ is distributive over $+$ if it is left- and right-distributive.

if $*$ is [[Commutative property|commutative]], the three conditions above are [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].
