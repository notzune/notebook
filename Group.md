a group in math is a [[Sets|set]] with an [[Operation|operation]] that satisfies the following constraints: the operation is [[Associative property|associative]] and has an [[Identity element|identity element]], and every element of the set has an [[Inverse element|inverse element]].

one of the more familiar groups is the set of [[Integer|integers]] with addition:

$$
\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,...\}
$$

for any two integers $a$ and $b$, the sum $a+b$ is also an integer. this [[Closure|closure]] property says that addition is a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] on $\mathbb{Z}$. the following properties help define the group axiom:

- for all integers $a,b,\text{ and }c$, one has $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ which is a demonstration of the [[Associative property|associative property]], more specifically the [[Associativities of Addition and Multiplication|associativities of addition]].
- if $a$ is any integer, then $0+a=a$ and $a+0=a$. [[Zero|zero]] is called the [[Identity element|identity element]] of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.
- for every integer $a$, there is an integer $b$ such that $a+b=0\text{ and }b+a=0$. the integer $b$ is called the [[Inverse element|inverse element]] of $a$ and is denoted $-a$.
