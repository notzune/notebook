in [[Set theory|set theory]] and its applications to logic, mathematics, and [[Computer science|computer science]], set-builder notation is a mathematical notation for describing a [[Sets|set]] by [[Enumeration|enumerating]] its elements, or stating the properties that its members must satisfy.

example we can use set builder notation to define the set of all even integers as,

$$
\{n\mid\exists k\in\mathbb{Z},n=2k\}
$$

defining sets by properties is also known as set comprehension, set abstraction, or as defining a set's [[Intension|intension]].
