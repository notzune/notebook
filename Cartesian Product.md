in [[Set theory|set theory]], the cartesian product is the product of the multiplication of two [[Sets|sets]] ($A\times B$) which results in a set of all [[Ordered pair|ordered pairs]] ($(a,b)$) where $a\in A \text{ and } b\in B$

this is also pretty much the same as [[Matrices|matrices]]

more elaboration for certain ***people***:

let $A$ and $B$ be two separate sets

$$
\begin{align}
A=\{a_1,a_2,a_3\} \\
B=\{b_1,b_2,b_3\} \\
\end{align}
$$

then the cartesian product of $A\times B$ would result in the set $AB$ where:

$$
AB=\{(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3)\}
$$
