in [[Algebra|algebra]], a quadratic equation is any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as

$$
ax^2+bx+c=0,
$$

where $x$ represents an unknown value, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent known numbers where $a\neq 0$. (if $a=0$ and $b\neq0$ then the equation is [[Linear|linear]], not a quadratic)

the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the [[Coefficient|coefficients]] of the equation and may be distinguished by calling them the *quadratic coefficient*, the *linear coefficient*, and the *constant coefficient* (or *free term*) respectively. 

the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are called solutions of the equation, and [[Zero|roots or zeros]] of the expression on its left-hand side.

a quadratic has at most two solutions. if there is only one solution, then that solution is a [[Multiplicity|double root]]. if all the coefficients are [[Real numbers|real numbers]], there are either two real solutions, or a single double root, or two [[Complex numbers|complex]] solutions that are [[Complex conjugate|complex conjugates]] of each other.

a quadratic always has two roots, if complex roots are included; and a double root is counted as two.

a quadratic can be [[Factorization|factored]] into an equivalent equation:

$$
ax^2+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)=0
$$

where $r$ and $s$ are the solutions for $x$.
