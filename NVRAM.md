non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) is [[RAM|random-access memory]] that retains data without applied power. this is in contract to [[DRAM|dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) and [[SRAM|static random-access memory]] (SRAM), which both maintain data only for as long as power is applied, or forms of [[Sequential-access memory (SAM)|sequential-access memory]] such as magnetic tape, which cannot be randomly access but which retains data indefinitely without power.
