the number of arguments or operands taken by a [[Function|function]], [[Operation|operation]], or [[Relations|relation]]. 

"arity" may also be called rank, but this word can have many other meanings. it may also be referred to as adicity and degree.

in general, functions or operators with a given arity follow the naming conventions of $n$-based numeral systems, such as [[Binary|binary]] and [[Hexadecimal|hexadecimal]].

for example:

- a [[Nullary|nullary]] function takes no arguments
	- $f( )=2$
- a [[Unary Operation|unary function]] takes one argument
	- $f(x) = 2x$
- a [[Binary operation|binary function]] takes two arguments
	- $f(x,y) = 2xy$
- a [[Ternary operation|ternary function]] takes three arguments
	- $f(x,y,z) = 2xyz$
- an $n$-ary function takes $n$ arguments
	- $f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},...,x_{n}) = 2\Pi_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$
