an electric current is a flow of [[Charged particles|charged particles]], such as [[Electrons|electrons]] or [[Ions|ions]], moving through an [[Conductor|electrical conductor]] or space.

it is defined as the net rate of flow of [[Electric charge|electric charge]] through a surface. it is denoted by the symbol $I$. 

in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), electric current is expressed in units of [[Ampere|ampere]] (called an "amp", symbol A), which is equivalent to one [[Coulomb|coulomb]] per second.
