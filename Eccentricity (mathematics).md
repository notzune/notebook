the eccentricity of a [[Conic sections|conic section]] is a non-negative [[Real numbers|real number]] that characterizes its shape. 

any conic section can be defined as the [[Locus of points|locus of points]] whose distances to a [[Point|point]] (the [[Focus|focus]]) and a [[Line|line]] (the [[Directrix|directrix]]) are in a constant ratio. that ratio is called the eccentricity, denoted as $e$.

one way of thinking of eccentricity is a measure of how much a conic section deviates from being circular:

- the eccentricity of a [[Circle|circle]] is 0
- the eccentricity of an [[Ellipse|ellipse]] is between 0 and 1
- the eccentricity of a [[Parabola|parabola]] is 1
- the eccentricity of a [[Hyperbolic functions|hyperbola]] is greater than 1

two conic sections with the same eccentricity are [[Similarity|similar]].
