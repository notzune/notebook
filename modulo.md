 the remainder of $b$ when divided by $n$: that is, 
 
 $$
 b\mod n
 $$ denotes the unique integer $r$ such that: 
 
 $$
 0\le r<n\text{ and }r\equiv b\pmod{n}
$$

 given two positive numbers $a$ and $n$, a modulo $n$ (often abbreviated as $a\mod{n}$) is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of $a$ by $n$, where $a$ is the dividend and $n$ is the divisor.
