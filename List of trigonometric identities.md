in [[Trigonometry|trigonometry]], trigonometric identities are [[Equality|equalities]] that involve [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric functions]] and are true for every value of the occurring [[Variables|variables]] for which both sides of the equality are defined.

they are different from the [[Triangle identities|triangle identities]] which involve angles but also some length of a triangle.

# [[Pythagorean trigonometric identity]]

the basic relationship between the [[Sine and cosine|sine and cosine]] is given by the Pythagorean identity:

$$
\sin^2\theta+\cos^2\theta=1
$$

where $\sin^2\theta$ means $(\sin\theta)^2$ and $\cos^2\theta$ means $(\cos\theta)^2$.
