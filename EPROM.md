stands for erasable programmable read-only memory.

it is a type of programmable read-only memory ([[PROM]]).

computer memory that can retrieve stored data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called [[non-volatile]].

it is an array of [[floating-gate]] [[transistors]] indivudally programmed by an electronic device supplying higher volatage than regular circuits.

once it is programmed can be erased by being exposed to a strong ultraviolet ([[UV]]) light such as from a mercury-vapor lamp.

the [[CMOS]] on motherboards is a type of EPROM that stores the [[BIOS]].
