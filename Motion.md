in [[Geometry|geometry]], a motion is an [[Isometry|isometry]] of a [[Metric space|metric space]]. the term motion is a synonym for [[Surjective functions|surjective]] isometry in metric geometry including [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic geometry]] and [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic geometry]].

they can be divided into direct and indirect motions. 

direct, proper or [[Rigid Motions|rigid motions]] are motions like [[Translation|translations]] and [[Rotation|rotations]] that preserve the orientation of a [[Chiral|chiral]] shape.

indirect or improper motions are motions like [[Reflection|reflections]], [[Glide reflection|glide reflections]], and [[Improper rotation|improper rotations]] that invert the orientation of a chiral shape.

given a geometry, the [[Sets|set]] of motions forms a [[Group|group]] under composition of mappings.
