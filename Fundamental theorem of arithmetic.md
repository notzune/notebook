states that every [[Integer|integer]] greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of [[Prime number|prime numbers]], up to the order of the factors.

for example,

$$
\begin{align}
1200&=2^4\cdot3^1\cdot5^2 \\
&=(2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot2)\cdot3\cdot(5\cdot5) \\
&=5\cdot2\cdot5\cdot2\cdot3\cdot2\cdot2\dots
\end{align}
$$

the requirement that the factors be prime is necessary; factorizations containing [[Composite number|composite numbers]] may not be unique (for example, $12=2\cdot6=3\cdot4$).
