a consequent is the second half of a hypothetical [[Proposistion|proposition]]. in the standard form of a proposition, it is the part that follows "then".

in an [[Implication|implication]], if $P$ implies $Q$, then $P$ is called the [[Antecedent|antecedent]] and $Q$ is called the consequent.

sometimes called the ***apodosis***.
