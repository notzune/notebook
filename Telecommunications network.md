in [[Network science|network science]], a telecommunications network is a group of [[Node (networking)|nodes]] interconnected by [[Telecommunications link|telecommunications links]] that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. 

the links may use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of [[Circuit switching|circuit switching]], [[Message switching|message switching]], or [[Packet switching|packet switching]], to pass messages and signals.

multiple nodes may cooperate to pass the message from an originating node to the destination node, via multiple network hops. 

for this routing function, each node in the network is assigned a [[Network address|network address]] for identification and locating it on the network. 

the collection of addresses in the network is called the [[Address space|address space]] of the network.

examples of telecommunications networks include computer networks, the [[Internet]], the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the global Telex network, the aeronautical ACARS network, and the wireless radio networks of cell phone telecommunication providers.
