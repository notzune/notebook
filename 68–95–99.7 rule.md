in [[Statistics|statistics]], the 68–95–99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule, is a shorthand to remember the percentage of values that lie within an [[Interval estimation|interval estimate]] in a [[Normal distribution|normal distribution]]: 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three [[Standard deviation|standard deviations]] of the [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]], respectively.

mathematically this can be expressed as follows, where $P()$ is the probability function, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $\mu$ is the mean:

$$
\begin{align}
P(\mu-1\sigma\leq X\leq\mu+1\sigma)\approx68.27\% \\
\\
P(\mu-2\sigma\leq X\leq\mu+2\sigma)\approx95.45\% \\
\\
P(\mu-3\sigma\leq X\leq\mu+3\sigma)\approx99.73\% \\
\end{align}
$$
