in mathematics, a singleton, also known as a unit set or one-point set, is a [[Sets|set]] with exactly one element.

for example, the set $\{0\}$ is a singleton whose single element is $0$.

within the framework of [[Set theory|set theory]], the [[Axiom of Regularity|axiom of regularity]] guarantees that no set is an element of itself. this implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains, thus $1$ and $\{1\}$ are not the same thing and the [[Empty set|empty set]] is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. ($\{\emptyset\}$). 

a set is a singleton if and only if its [[Cardinality|cardinality]] is $1$.

in [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|von Nuemann's set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers]], the number $1$ is defined as the singleton $\{0\}$.

in axiomatic set theory, the existence of singletons is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of the [[Axiom of pairing|axiom of pairing]]: for any set $A$, the axiom applied to $A$ and $A$ assets the existence of $\{A,A\}$, which is the same as the singleton $\{A\}$ (since it contains $A$, and no other set, as an element).

if $A$ is any set and $S$ is any singleton, then there exists precisely one [[Function|function]] from $A$ to $S$, the function sending every element of $A$ to the single element of $S$.

thus every singleton is a [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] in the [[Category of sets|category of sets]].

a singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is [[Injective functions|injective]]. The only non-singleton set with this property is the [[Empty set|empty set]].
