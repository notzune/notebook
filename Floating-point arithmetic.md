floating-point arithmetic is a way to represent [[Real numbers|real numbers]] on [[Computer|computers]]. 

each floating-point number is represented using three key parts: the [[Sign|sign]] which indicates if it is positive or negative, the [[Exponent|exponent]] which determines the scale or [[Magnitude|magnitude]] of the number, and the [[Mantissa|mantissa]].

floating-point is limited by its precision so one must be careful with potential rounding errors that may occur when using `float`(s).
