in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], the multinomial distribution is a generalization of the [[Binomial distribution|binomial distribution]]. for eample it models the probability of counts for each side of a $k$-sided [[Dice (die)|dice]] rolled $n$ times.

for $n$ [[Independence|independent]] trails each of which leads to a success for exactly one of $k$ categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers of successes for the various categories.
