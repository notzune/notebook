in [[Probability theory|probability theory]], odds provide a measure of the [[Likelihood function|likelihood]] of a particular [[Outcome|outcome]]. they are calculated as the ratio of the number of events that produce that outcome to the number that do not.

odds are commonly used in gambling and [[Statistics|statistics]].

odds also have a simple relation with [[Probability|probability]]: the odds of an outcome are the ratio of the probability that the outcome occurs to the probability that the outcome does not occur.

$$
\text{odds}=\frac{p}{1-p}
$$

where $p$ is the probability of the outcome.
