the complement of some [[Sets|set]] A (denoted by $\overline{A}$ and sometimes as $A^\complement\space$) is the set containing all [[Element|elements]] not contained in $A$.

$$
\overline{A} = \{x \mid x \notin A\}
$$

a complement can also be found from the [[Union|union]] or [[Intersection|intersection]] of two sets, such as:

$$
(\overline{A\cup B})=\{x\mid x\notin A,B\}
$$
