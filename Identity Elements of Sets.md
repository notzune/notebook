identities for dealing with [[Empty set|empty sets]] ($\emptyset$) and the [[Universal set|universal set]] ($U$):

when taking the [[Union|union]] of any [[Sets|set]] ($A$) and the empty set ($\emptyset$) the set doesn't change:

$$
A\cup\emptyset = A
$$

when taking the [[Intersection|intersection]] of any set ($A$) and the universal set ($U$) the set doesn't change:

$$
A\cap U = A
$$
