identities for dealing with empty sets ($\emptyset$) and the universal set ($U$):

when taking the union of any set ($A$) and the empty set ($\emptyset$) the set doesn't change:

$$
A\cup\emptyset = A
$$

when taking the intersection of any set ($A$) and the universal set ($U$) the set doesn't change:

$$
A\cap U = A
$$
