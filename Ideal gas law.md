the ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. 

it is a combination of the empirical [[Boyle's law]], [[Charles's Law]], [[Avogadro's law]], and [[Gay-Lussac's law]].

the ideal gas law is written empirically as:

$$
pV=nRT
$$

where $p$, $V$ and $T$ are the [[Pressure|pressure]], [[Volume|volume]], and [[Temperature|temperature]] respectively; $n$ is the [[Amount of substance|amount of substance]]; and $R$ is the [[Ideal gas constant|ideal gas constant]]. 

the empirical formula can be expanded further into

$$
pV=nRT=nk_bN_{\text{A}}T=Nk_BT
$$

where:
- $p$ is the absolute pressure of the gas
- $V$ is the volume of the gas
- $n$ is the amount of substance of gas (number of moles)
- $R$ is the ideal, or universal, gas constant equal to the product of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro constant]].
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
- $N_{\text{A}}$ is the [[Avogadro constant]]
- $T$ is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the gas
- $N$ is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) of the gas

$R$ has for value $8.314\space\text{J}/(\text{mol}\cdot\text{K})=1.989\approx2\space(\text{cal}\cdot\text{K}),\text{ or }0.0821\space\text{L}\cdot\text{atm}/(\text{mol}\cdot\text{K})$

how much gas is present could be specified by giving the mass instead of the chemical amount of gas. therefore, an alternate form of the ideal gas law may be used:

the chemical amount, $n$ (in moles), is equal to total mass of the gas ($m$) (in kilograms) divided by the [[Molar mass|molar mass]], $M$ (in kilograms per mole):

$$
n=\frac{m}{M}
$$

by replacing $n$ with $m/M$ and also introducing [[Density|density]] $\rho=m/V$, we get:

$$
\begin{align}
pV&=\frac{m}{M}RT \\
\\
p&=\frac{m}{V}\frac{RT}{M} \\
\\
p&=\rho\frac{R}{M}T \\
\end{align}
$$

by defining the specific gas constant $R_{\text{specific}}$ as the ratio $R/M$

$$
p=\rho R_{\text{specific}}T
$$

this form of the gas law is useful because it links [[Pressure|pressure]], [[Density|density]], and [[Temperature|temperature]] in a unique formula independent of the quantity of the considered gas.

it can also be written in terms of the [[Specific volume|specific volume]] v, the reciprocal of density, as

$$
pv=R_{\text{specific}}T
$$
