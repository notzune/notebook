the ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. 

it is a combination of the empirical [[Boyle's law]], [[Charles's Law]], [[Avogadro's law]], and [[Gay-Lussac's law]].

the ideal gas law is written empirically as:

$$
pV=nRT
$$

where $p$, $V$ and $T$ are the [[Pressure|pressure]], [[Volume|volume]], and [[Temperature|temperature]] respectively; $n$ is the [[Amount of substance|amount of substance]]; and $R$ is the [[Ideal gas constant|ideal gas constant]]. 

the empirical formula can be expanded further into

$$
pV=nRT=nk_bN_{\text{A}}T=Nk_BT
$$

where:
- $p$ is the absolute pressure of the gas
- $V$ is the volume of the gas
- $n$ is the amount of substance of gas (number of moles)
- $R$ is the ideal, or universal, gas constant equal to the product of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro constant]].
- $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]]
- $N_{\text{A}}$ is the [[Avogadro constant]]
- $T$ is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the gas
- $N$ is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) of the gas

$R$ has for value $8.314\space\text{J}/(\text{mol}\cdot\text{K})=1.989\approx2\space\text{cal}
