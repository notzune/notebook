much like the definition of a [[Variables|variable]] in mathematics, a variable in programming/computer science is any "placeholder" for some kind of known or unknown quantity of data or [[Object (computer science)|object]] referred to as a value. 

or in simpler terms, a variable is a named container for a particular set of [[Bit|bits]] or type of data (like [[Integer (data type)|integer]], [[Float (data type)|float]], [[String (data type)|string]] etc...). 

formally, a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name.
