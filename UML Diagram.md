UML stands for the unified modeling language. UML diagrams show relationships among [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] and [[Object (computer science)|objects]]. 

a UML class diagram consists of one or more classes, each with sections for the class name, attributes (data), and operations ([[Function (computer programming)|methods]])

lines between classes represent associations; a dotted arrow shows that the one class *uses* the other (calls its methods)
