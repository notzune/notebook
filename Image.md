the image of a [[Function|function]] is the [[Sets|set]] of all output values it may produce.

more generally, evaluating a given function $f$ at each element of a given [[Subset|subset]] $A$ of its [[Domain|domain]] produces a set, called the "image of $A$ under (or through) $f''$"

similarly, the inverse image (or [[Preimage|preimage]]) of a given subset $B$ of the [[Codomain|codomain]] of $f$ is the set of all elements of the domain that map to the members of $B$.

image and inverse image may also be defined for general [[Binary relation|binary relations]], not just functions.

## Definition

the word "image" is used in three related ways, in these definitions, $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a function from the set $X$ to the set $Y$.

### Image of an element

if $x$ is a member of $X$ then the image of $x$ under $f$, denoted $f(x)$, is the value of $f$ when applied to $x$. $f(x)$ is alternatively known as the output of $f$ for argument $x$.

given $y$, the function $f$ is said to "take the value $y$" or "take $y$ as a value" if there is some $x$ in the function's domain such that $f(x)=y$. 

given a set $S$, $f$ is said to "take a value in $S$" if there exists some $x$ in the function's domain such that $f(x)\in S$.

however, "$f$ takes \[all] values in $S$" and "$f$ is valued in $S$" means that $f(x)\in S$ for every point $x$ in $f$'s domain.

## Image of a subset

throughout, let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function. the image under $f$ of a subset $A$ of $X$ is the set of all $f(a)$ for $a\in A$ it is denoted by $f|A|$, or by $f(A)$, where there is no risk of confusion. using [[Set builder notation|set builder notation]], this can be written as:

$$
f|A|=\{f(a):a\in A\}
$$
