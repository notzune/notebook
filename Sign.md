the sign of a [[Real numbers|real number]] is its property of being either positive, negative, or 0.

in some contexts it makes sense to consider a [[Signed zero|signed zero]] (such as when working with [[Floating-point arithmatic|floating-points]]). depending on the context, zero may be considered as being neither positive nor negative (having no sign) or it may be considered as being both (having both signs).

the phrase "change of sign" is associated with the generation of the [[Additive inverse|additive inverse]].
