# Mean, median, and mode

in a normal (or Gaussian) distribution, the terms "mean," "median," and "mode" represent different measures of central tendency, but they all coincide at the same point in the distribution.

- [[Weighted arithmetic mean|mean]]: this is the arithmetic average of all the values in the distribution. in a normal distribution, it's also the point where the distribution is centered. the mean determines the location of the center of the distribution.
- [[Median|median]]: this is the middle value of the dataset when it is ordered from the smallest to the largest. in a normal distribution, 50% of the values lie below the median and 50% lie above it. the median divides the area under the normal curve into two equal parts.
- [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]: this represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. for a normal distribution, the mode is the peak of the curve, where the greatest number of observations are concentrated.

in a perfectly normal distribution, these three measures of central tendency are all located at the same point on the x-axis. 

this is because a normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. the highest point on the curve (the mode) is exactly at the mean, and because the distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, half of the values lie on each side of the mean, making the mean also the median.

this alignment of the mean, median, and mode at the same point is a specific property of the normal distribution and does not necessarily apply to other types of distributions, where these measures can be different and indicate different features of the distribution's shape (e.g., skewness). 

in skewed distributions, the mean, median, and mode will not coincide and will instead provide insights into the direction and intensity of the skew.
