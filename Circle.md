a circle is a [[Shape|shape]] consisting of all [[Point|points]] in a [[Euclidean plane|plane]] that are at a given distance from a given point, the [[Center (geometry)|center]]. it is also a [[Conic sections|conic section]].

# Terminology

- [[Annulus|annulus]] - a ring-shaped object, a region bounded by two [[Concentric objects|concentric]] circles.
- centre - the point [[Equidistant|equidistant]] from all points on the circle
- [[Circular arc|arc]] - any connected part of a circle. specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.
