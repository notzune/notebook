in [[Mathematical logic|logic]], a predicate is a symbol that represents a property or a relation, for example in the [[First-order logic|first-order ]]formula $P(a)$, the symbol $P$ is a predicate that applies to the [[Non-logical symbol|individual constant]] $a$

likewise, in the formula $R(a,b)$, the symbol $R$ is a predicate that applies to the individual constants $a$ and $b$.

in the semantics of logic, predicates are interpreted as [[Relation|relations]].
