in [[Set theory|set theory]] an intersection of two [[Sets|sets]] $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the set containing all elements of $A$ that also belong to $B$ or equivalently, all elements of $B$ that also belong to $A$

## Examples

$$
\begin{align}
\{1,2,3\}\cap\{2,3,4\}=\{2,3\} \\
\\
\{1,2,3\}\cap\{4,5,6\}=\emptyset \\
\\
\mathbb{Z}\cap\mathbb{N}=\mathbb{N} \\
\\
\{x\in\mathbb{R}:x^{2}=1\}\cap\mathbb{N}=\{1\}
\end{align}
