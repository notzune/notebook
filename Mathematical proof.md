a mathematical proof is a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[Argument–deduction–proof distinctions|argument]] for a [[Proposition|mathematical statement]], showing that the stated assumptions [[Mathematical logic|logically]] guarantee the conclusion.

the [[Argument|argument]] may use other previously established statements, such as [[Theorem|theorems]]; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic original assumptions known as [[Axiom|axioms]], along with the accepted rules of [[Inferences|inference]].
