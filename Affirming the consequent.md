in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], affirming the consequent (sometimes called the converse error, fallacy of the converse, or confusion of necessity and sufficiency) is a [[Logical fallacy|formal fallacy]] of taking a true [[Conditional statement|conditional statement]] under certain assumptions and invalidly inferring it's [[Converse (Logic)|converse]]; even though that statement may not be true under the same assumptions.

example, taking the true conditional statement: "if the lamp were broken, then the room would be dark" and make the assumption that "there are no other lights in the room, it is nighttime and the windows are closed" and invalidly inferring the converse "the room is dark, so the lamp must be broken".

this is a fallacy because the [[Consequent|consequent]] ("the room would be dark") has other possible [[Antecedent|antecedents]]. (for example, "the lamp is in working order, but is switched off" or "there is no lamp in the room").

the opposite statement, denying the consequent, is called [[Modus tollens|modus tollens]] and *is* a [[Validity|valid]] form of argument.
