in mathematics, a structure is a [[Sets|set]] provided with some additional features on the set (e.g. an [[Operation|operation]], [[Relation|relation]], [[Metric space|metric]], or [[Topological space|topology]]).

often, the additional features are attached or related to the set, so as to provide it with some additional meaning or significance.
